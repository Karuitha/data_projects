If adults trade off sleep for work, what is the sign of $\\beta_{1}$?\n\nb.  What signs do you think $\\beta_{2}$ and $\\beta_{3}$ will have?\n\nc.  Using the data in `SLEEP75.csv`, the estimated equation is;\n\n$sleep = 3638.25 − 0.148totwrk − 11.13educ + 2.20age$,\n\n$n = 706$\n\n$R^{2} = 0.113$\n\nIf someone works five more hours per week, by how many minutes is sleep predicted to fall? Is this a large trade-off?\n\nd. Discuss the sign and magnitude of the estimated coefficient on educ.\n\ne. Would you say totwrk, educ, and age explain much of the variation in sleep? What other factors might affect the time spent sleeping? Are these likely to be correlated with totwrk?\n\n# **Question Two**\n\nUsing the same data of previous problem (SLEEP75.csv ), we obtain the estimated equation. \n\n$sleep = 3840.83 − 0.163totwrk − 11.71educ − 8.70age + 0.128age 2 + 87.75male$,\n\nThe standard errors for the coefficients are 235.11, 0.018, 5.86, 11.21, .134, and 34.33. The number of observations, n is 706, $R^{2} = 0.123$ and adjusted $R^{2} = 0.117$\n\n\nThe variable sleep is total minutes per week spent sleeping at night, totwrk is total weekly minutes spent working, educ and age are measured in years, and male is a gender dummy.\n\na. All other factors being equal, is there evidence that men sleep more than women? How strong is the evidence?\nb. Is there a statistically significant trade-off between working and sleeping? What is the estimated trade-off?\nc. What other regression do you need to run to test the null hypothesis that, holding other factors fixed, age has no effect on sleeping?\n\n\n# **Question Three**\n\nUse the data in SLEEP75.csv 1 for this exercise. The equation of interest is;\n\n$sleep = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1} totwrk + \\beta_{2} educ + \\beta_{3} age + \\beta_{4} age 2 + \\beta_{5} yngkid + u$\n\na. Estimate this equation separately for men and women and report the results in the usual form. Are there notable differences in the two estimated equations?\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlm_men <- lm(sleep ~ totwrk + educ + age + + age^2 + yngkid, data = sleep %>% filter(male == 1))\n\nlm_women <- lm(sleep ~ totwrk + educ + age + age^2 + yngkid, data = sleep %>% filter(male == 0))\n\nstargazer(lm_men, lm_women, align=TRUE, \n          \n          dep.var.labels= \"Sleep: Male vs Female\",\n          \n          covariate.labels = c(\"Total work\", \"Education\", \"Age\", \n                               \"Age Squared\", \"Young Kid\"),\n          \n          type = \"text\",\n          \n          title = \"Table 1: Summary Statistics of Regression Analysis for Sleep Patterns\"\n          \n          )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n\nTable 1: Summary Statistics of Regression Analysis for Sleep Patterns\n==================================================================\n                                 Dependent variable:              \n                    ----------------------------------------------\n                                Sleep: Male vs Female             \n                              (1)                    (2)          \n------------------------------------------------------------------\nTotal work                 -0.181***              -0.145***       \n                            (0.024)                (0.028)        \n                                                                  \nEducation                  -13.036*                -10.742        \n                            (7.405)                (9.611)        \n                                                                  \nAge                         3.387*                  -0.089        \n                            (1.990)                (2.426)        \n                                                                  \nAge Squared                 58.841                 -98.502        \n                           (58.669)                (92.674)       \n                                                                  \nYoung Kid                3,719.639***            3,680.998***     \n                           (154.484)              (183.635)       \n                                                                  \n------------------------------------------------------------------\nObservations                  400                    306          \nR2                           0.156                  0.090         \nAdjusted R2                  0.148                  0.077         \nResidual Std.
