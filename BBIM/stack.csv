"How can I prevent firefox from closing when I press ctrl-w","<p>In my favorite editor (vim), I regularly use ctrl-w to execute a certain action. Now, it quite often happens to me that firefox is the active window (on windows) while I still look at vim (thinking vim is the active window) and press ctrl-w which closes firefox. This is not what I want. Is there a way to stop ctrl-w from closing firefox?</p>

"Safari only displays PHP code - Firefox asks which app to display same","<p>Aloha everyone,</p>

<p>I have a class assignment in which I am tasked to build a MySql database, then use PHP to retrieve the contents of the table in the database.  When I attempt to open this in Safari, it only outputs the HTML/PHP code.  Firefox, on the other hand, pops up a window asking me to select an application to work with the code.  Here is the code itself.  Can anyone see where my error lies and/or point me in the right direction to get this actually interpreted and display correctly?  Any and all assistance will be greatly appreciated.</p>

"Minimum SQL login permissions for an AD domain group","<p>I've created a web application that uses a SQL Server 2008 R2 database in the background. Application uses integrated security SSPI connection to database so users need granted access to database server.</p>

<p>All users that should be using the app are members of a particular AD domain group.</p>

<h2>This is what I've done</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>I've added a new Security Login on SQL Server level and provided AD domain group name which gets displayed as a group (based on icon)</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/TJieE.png"" alt=""Server Login as group""></p></li>
<li><p>Then I've opened this server login properties dialog and opened <strong>User Mapping</strong> settings where I checked my particular database that I want users of this AD domain group to access (see below in the image)</p></li>
<li><p>In the list below are displayed <strong>Database role memberships</strong> where <strong>public</strong> is checked.</p></li>
<li><p>I created all objects in my database as a separate SQL Server user with <strong>securityadmin</strong> permission and provided schema <strong>dbo</strong> with every object as in:</p>

<pre><code>create table dbo.SomeTable ...
create procedure dbo.SomeProcedure ...
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>All database manipulation is done via <strong>stored procedures only</strong>. No table is directly accessed by the application.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Based on these facts (dbo schema with my objects, AD domain group security login, stored procedure execution only) I wonder which role membership should be set on AD domain group server login to use my database.</p>

<p>Users should have permission to execute stored procedures. These on the other hand do everything else. CRUD operations on tables, execute user defined functions and call each other as well.</p>

<h2>Question</h2>

<p>Setting <strong>db_datareader</strong> and <strong>db_datawriter</strong> (as seen below) isn't sufficient as implied by the error screen my users get (stored procedures supposedly don't exists)?</p>

<p><strong>How do I set security permissions on my AD domain group so it will be able to see <code>dbo</code> objects and execute those stored procedures?</strong></p>

  support transportability, Excel writes BIFF files where the low-order
  byte of the word appears first in the file, followed by the highorder
  byte.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If I understand that correctly (not sure that I do) big endian of the words are used, so that what I'm looking for is actually 2312(0908h). This makes the impression of being correct as it is found very early in every file i try.</p>

<p>So then over to the next step:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>4, Read the Globals substream, loading the BoundSheet8 records and the SST into memory. For more details, see Globals.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I look for 133(8500h) and it's found shortly after BOF, good. But the problem lies in the two next steps:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>5, From the BoundSheet8 record that corresponds to the substream you want to open, read the first 4 bytes, which contains the lbPlyPos FilePointer.
  6, Go to the offset in the stream specified by the lbPlyPos FilePointer. This is the BOF record for the worksheet.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So the following 4 bytes is a pointer that points to a position in the file I should go to. But reading those bytes in any order gives me a number that is larger than the whole file. And also, this part confuses me: ""This is the BOF record for the worksheet."" Wasn't that what I found in an earlier step? Hmm...</p>

<p>Sorry for my rambling. And I hope I make sense and that someone would be willing to help me a little.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong>
Okay, I've gotten a little further with this. It's quite confusing to me but it seems that each record is also read as ""big endian"", ie the last variable in the record is the one that is positioned earliest in the file. Though I don't know if it applies to values with variable length? So, looking at <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd773237%28v=office.12%29.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a>, the values of variable length are listed as the last one in a record. But obviously they can't come as the first in the file because there would be no way to know how many bytes to read in if that info comes after it?
Anyway, if I ignore this value, and and skip 2 bytes for dt and A/unused and read the following 4 bytes as a uint it turns out as 1130 in my case. Adding that to the pos of the first BOF gives me the exact position of the sheet-BOF. And that cant be a coincidence, right?</p>

<p>Now the next problem arises. After that BOF-record the index-record is supposed to follow immediately. But no matter in what way I read in the bytes it still makes no sense...
Here's what it looks like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>09 08 10 00 00 06 10 00 BB 0D CC 07 00 00 00 00 06 00 00 00 00 02 0E
  00 00 00 00 00 1E 00 00 00 00 00 12 00 00 00 3E 02 12 00 B6 06 00 00
  00 00 40 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 7D 00 0C 00 00 00 00 00 DD
  06 0F 00 00 00 00 00 7D 00 0C 00 02 00 02 00 DD 06 0F 00 00 00 00 00
  7D 00 0C 00 04 00 04 etc...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The first 2 bytes there being the BOF record 09 08, or 0809 swapped which is 2057 (which represents BOF) so the rest should be the <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd907627.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">INDEX</a> but doesn't make sense... I would greatly appreciate if someone could help me with this.</p>

"How to prevent automated request?","<p>I was wondering how to set up a system in which an authenticated user could send, with a simple graphical interaction (cliccking a button or so) a non-replayable request/message to the server from an application or a web page.
It's crytical there's must not be a way to set up an automated system that replaces user interaction automating the request as this would totally break up my entire project.
Moreover, as this action must be frequently repeated, it should not implement boring stuff like chaptas or so.</p>

<p>A pratical example: let's say the web page, shown after the login, displays a button that sends the server a request. How can I be sure the request was sent because the user actually clicked the button and it wasn't some sort of bot that forged the message?</p>

<p>Is that even possible to check? I'm sure it is and I'm quite sure there's must be some simple implementation I'm missing, and I'm sorry if this is a trivial question.
Also, if the solution is hiding ('cause I already searched a lot!) out there, please point me to it.</p>

"How to get WS-Security certificate to be accepted by Java application","<p>So I've been struggling with WS-Security for some time now, slowly making progress. First let me briefly describe my setup. I have Java application running in a tomcat, which offers a webservice endpoint (using Spring). I want incoming messages to be signed. I am testing with SoapUI. So after a long struggle, I got the server as far as checking incoming messages for a signature and I also got SoapUI, to sign outgoing messages. However, the server keeps rejecting the certificate and I'm not sure where I'm doing something wrong, i.e. am I sending the wrong certificate information with my test requests, or have I not correctly maintained the certificate in the truststore.

<p>I believe it is 1.  But in the facebook documentation it says, batch requests api calls are calculated as if they were many individual calls.  Since field expansion is also a ""batch request"", I am confused how they calculate.</p>

<p>I believe the number of calls will either be one of the following :
<br>1.  1 - line of code
<br>2.  100 - number of friends
<br>3.  100 * (1 + 1) = 200 - 1 each for name and books</p>

"Stop arrow keys changing pages when on Google.com","<p>I find that when I type search terms into a browser, suggestions come up. Not from history but popular search terms. Fine.</p>

<p>But When I hold the forward arrow to put the cursor at the end of what i've typed,(not talking about using the end key), it completes what I write from popular search terms.</p>

<p>I want to stop this behavior. </p>

<p>As an example, if I type min (cursor is at end), then I push the right arrow, it completes it to say minefield.  So if the cursor were in the middle and I held right arrow it'd have the same effect. I want to remove this effect.</p>

<p>This happens in Chrome or IE so is an issue with using Google.com  I'm interested in good ways to deal with this so arrow keys function normally</p>

"FQL to search newsfeed","<p>I am having a strange issue with an app that I am developing. I am using PHP SDK to call the Graph API on server side and here is my code that calls the API:</p>

<pre><code>$params = array('q' =&gt; 'George', 'limit' =&gt; 100);

$newsfeed = $facebook-&gt;api('/me/home', 'GET', $params);
</code></pre>

<p>And next is the code to render HTML of the newsfeed. I have a footer below that once clicked, loads further posts. But what I have observed is that in case of searching the newsfeed by providing additional 'q' parameter, we do not get results beyond one week.</p>

<p>Now I am giving a second try to FQL instead of Graph API. Good thing with Graph API was that appending a q parameter to /me/home would do the searching for you automatically and you had nothing to do. But with FQL, this does not seems to be the case as per the following documentation suggests:</p>

<p><a href=""http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/fql/stream/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/fql/stream/</a></p>

<p>My idea is to use following FQL:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT post_id, actor_id, target_id, message, comments, likes FROM stream WHERE filter_key in (SELECT filter_key FROM stream_filter WHERE uid = me() AND type = 'newsfeed') AND strpos(message, 'facebook') &gt;= 0

<p>Any ideas how the search can be implemented? I actually want to emulate the news feed within the application so please enlighten me about batching multiple FQL queries if you have any ideas on that.</p>

"Security issues regarding links in PHPBB2","<p>I've recently edited some regexps on a phpbb2's bbcode.php and I'm wondering if it'd bring security issues (regarding script injection from href, mainly (if it's even possible)).</p>

<p>I edited only the [url], [url=] and my newly created [url=""""] bbcode tags.</p>

<p>Their original regexps (dated to 2008) didn't allow ""invalid"" characters such as parentheses or white spaces in the url value (which are needed for some Wikipedia pages and file hosting services' URLs), so instead of encoding the URLs' special characters as suggested by others, I just edited the regex to allow alphanumeric characters in the protocols and basically any character in the domain/rest of the url address.</p>

<p>The new regexps inside phpbb2's bbencode_second_pass function ($text = post's text):</p>

<pre><code>// matches a [url]xxxx://www.phpbb.com[/url] code..
$patterns[] = ""#\[url\]([\w]+?://.*?)\[/url\]#is"";
$replacements[] = $bbcode_tpl['url1'];

// [url]www.phpbb.com[/url] code.. (no xxxx:// prefix).
$patterns[] = ""#\[url\]((www|ftp)\..*?)\[/url\]#is"";
$replacements[] = $bbcode_tpl['url2'];

// [url=xxxx://www.phpbb.com]phpBB[/url] code..
$patterns[] = ""#\[url=([\w]+?://.*?)\]([^?\n\r\t].*?)\[/url\]#is"";
$replacements[] = $bbcode_tpl['url3'];

// [url=www.phpbb.com]phpBB[/url] code.. (no xxxx:// prefix).
$patterns[] = ""#\[url=((www|ftp)\..*?)\]([^?\n\r\t].*?)\[/url\]#is"";
$replacements[] = $bbcode_tpl['url4'];


// [url=""xxxx://www.phpbb.com""]phpBB[/url] code..
$patterns[] = ""#\[url=&amp;quot;([\w]+?://.*?)&amp;quot;\]([^?\n\r\t].*?)\[/url\]#is""; //closes on first ""]
//$patterns[] = ""#\[url=&amp;quot;([\w]+?://.*?)&amp;quot;\](?![\w\n\s]*&amp;quot;\])([^?\n\r\t].*?)\[/url\]#is""; //closes on last ""] //discarded, ambigous

$replacements[] = $bbcode_tpl['email'];


$text = preg_replace($patterns, $replacements, $text);

// Remove our padding from the string..
$text = substr($text, 1);

return $text;
</code></pre>

<p>And the unedited phpbb2 declarations:</p>

<pre><code>$bbcode_tpl['url1'] = str_replace('{URL}', '\\1', $bbcode_tpl['url']);
$bbcode_tpl['url1'] = str_replace('{DESCRIPTION}', '\\1', $bbcode_tpl['url1']);

$bbcode_tpl['url2'] = str_replace('{URL}', 'http://\\1', $bbcode_tpl['url']);
$bbcode_tpl['url2'] = str_replace('{DESCRIPTION}', '\\1', $bbcode_tpl['url2']);

$bbcode_tpl['url3'] = str_replace('{URL}', '\\1', $bbcode_tpl['url']);
$bbcode_tpl['url3'] = str_replace('{DESCRIPTION}', '\\2', $bbcode_tpl['url3']);

$bbcode_tpl['url4'] = str_replace('{URL}', 'http://\\1', $bbcode_tpl['url']);
$bbcode_tpl['url4'] = str_replace('{DESCRIPTION}', '\\3', $bbcode_tpl['url4']); 
</code></pre>

<p>This works perfectly fine with my debugging so far, now I'd like to ask if, by allowing any character to be placed inside the A tag's href attribute I'd exposing my users or myself to any hacker attack?</p>

<p>Say, I tested the javascript URI hack (javascript:) and it doesn't seem to work even on Internet Explorer, and I don't know of any way of injecting a script through the href attribute of an A tag, would there be any risk in allowing my users to type whatever they like (as long as there's either a valid alphanumeric protocol such as *:// or www. which will have a http:// placed prior to it) in the href of  tags?</p>

<p>Please note that I'm not considering linking to malicious sites, I want to know if hackers would be able to inject scripts/cookies/whatever through the href of an  tag without the user clicking on it!</p>

<p>Now it sounds a little redundant to have a href attribute run anything without its  tag being clicked, but anyway, is there a way for a hacker to inject malicious code/javascript in the document through the href attribute?</p>

<p>And then, at the PHP which it's supposed to generate the excel:</p>

<pre><code>header(""Content-type: application/vnd.ms-excel; name='excel'"");
header(""Content-Disposition: filename=ficheroExcel.xls"");  
header(""Pragma: no-cache"");  
header(""Expires: 0"");

then :

"How to unhide user removed aggregations","<p>I came across an issue where, just to try it out, I removed an aggregation from a timeline app. I then was unable to get the aggregation back.</p>

<p>Steps to take: </p>

<ol>
<li>add an app to your timeline (For example <a href=""http://pose.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pose.com</a>)</li>
<li>create some actions</li>
<li>once an aggregation shows up in the timeline app, remove it by clicking the edit icon in the title bar of the aggregation. Note: do not hide the 'recent activity' but hide any other aggregation</li>
</ol>

<p>From a user's perspective: how can a user unhide this aggregation? </p>

<ul>
<li>I have looked in the app-settings ('Account Settings' > 'Apps') but there are no options for aggregations.</li>
<li>removing the app, and then adding it again also does not work. Recent activities show fine, but any other aggregations have disappeared</li>
</ul>

<p>From an app's perspective: how can an app unhide this aggregation? </p>

<ul>
<li>can I see (API call) which aggregations have been hidden by the user?</li>
<li>can I then ask the users to un-hide the aggregation?</li>
<li>is there an API call do un-hide an aggregation?</li>

"Last save date in excel worksheet footer","<p>I am using Excel 2007 with a workbook that has many sheets. I need to have the date when the worksheet was last saved - in the footer. I was able to find the following:</p>

<pre><code>Private Sub Workbook_BeforeSave(ByVal SaveAsUI As Boolean, Cancel As Boolean)

Dim ws As Worksheet

For Each ws In ThisWorkbook.Worksheets
With ws.PageSetup
.LeftFooter = ""Last Save Time: &amp;T""
.RightFooter = ""Last Save Date: &amp;D""
End With
Next ws

Set ws = Nothing

End Sub

<p>This changes every worksheet. I need it to only change a sheet that has been edited (so each worksheet can have a different date).
Is this even possible? Should I use a cell instead of a footer? Or do I have to create multiple workbooks?</p>

"After Facebook Connect logout, Facebook PHP class still thinks user is logged in","<p>When a user first hits my site's login screen, I have Facebook Connect determine if the user is logged into Facebook and reload the page if true:</p>

if ($Facebook-&gt;get_loggedin_user()) {
  // Log the user in.
}

<p>When that's clicked, the user is successfully logged out of Facebook, but the backend Facebook PHP object still thinks the user is logged in (<code>$Facebook-&gt;get_loggedin_user()</code> still returns their user ID), so my login code then logs them in again automatically.</p>

<p>So the problem I'm finding is that even though Facebook Connect logs the user out, the backend Facebook PHP object still considers the user logged in. Does anyone know how to overcome this? Can I not login the user automatically with my PHP code?</p>

<p>now when i try to deploy on tomcat i get the following exception:</p>

<pre><code>org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanCreationException: Error creating bean with name 'userDetailsService': Injection of autowired dependencies failed; nested exception
is org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanCreationException: Could not autowire field: private org.intan.pedigree.dao.UserEntityDAO org.intan.pedigree.service.UserDetailsS

</code></pre>

<p>and not mater what i do I can not figure out what is wrong with it. Any advice would be welcome.</p>

"Compatibility issue with Chrome/Firefox","<p>My site is available at: <a href=""http://www.innexdesign.co.uk/dev"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.innexdesign.co.uk/dev</a> . The site works perfectly in IE and most pages are also fine in Firefox and Chrome. 
However if we navigate to the ""Designs"" Menu and hover down the choices: ""Designs for Drinking"", ""Designs for Eating"" etc you see the logo and fitter divs appear to move a bit further down as you hover over them.
Similarly if you were to select ""Designs for drinking"" and hover over the individual pubs you would again see the logo and footer divs appear to move down the page as you hover over them. This also happens in ""Designs for Eating"", ""Designs for Housing"" and ""Designs for Sleeping"".</p>

"Is facebook's content dynamically loaded?","<p>When a link is clicked on facebook, the top header bar doesn't flicker at all. I'm used to seeing this effect on pages where the content is loaded via ajax, but on Chrome, the url is changing, and, so far as I know, that means that a new page was loaded. </p>

<p>In javascript, I know the url can't be changed without a redirect, but the hashtag can, so I'm finding this very intriguing. I thought this might be something chrome does, where it loads a webpage before taking you off the previous one to create a seamless experience, so I tried it on Internet Explorer. On IE, the same effect is made, but this time the url doesn't change, just the hashtag. I tried on FireFox as well, and it changes the URL the same way chrome does.</p>

<p>What's going on here?  </p>

"how to manage an asymmetric key inside a key container for an enterprise software?","<p>hello
i have an educational software that should be installed on different PCs across the enterprise.
my program is using a 5000 text, xml, html files as source of it's content. i don't want my source to be tampered with, copied or used illegally. what i intend to do is to encrypt my source seperately and then put the encrypted files in a folder inside of my app so later my app can read and decrypt each file that is requested by user. the app will be installed and used anywhere.
but the problem is that to secure and store the encryption key inside my application i have to use a key container while as far as i remember(correct me if i'm wrong) they're machine based and can't be used on different machines while i need my key to be fixed for all the installed copies on any PC. i know a lot of softwares using such a architecture but i don't know how do they do that. </p>

<p>Everything is working fine but problem comes when user delete content of few rows before uploading the excel. It reads those empty rows as well along with non empty rows, and saving data in database fails because of business rule violation (mandatory field missing).
What I tried is putting where condition in query :</p>

<pre><code>""SELECT * FROM  WHERE  not [CandidateId*] = 0 or not [Firstname*] = '' or not [Lastname] = '' or not [type*] = '' or not [DOB*] ="" + DBNull.Value
</code></pre>

<p>So it will select only those rows which has data.
But I am not able to compare non string field i.e. Date, Integer etc. Which are comming as DBNull when empty.
Can any one please suggest the way to do it, I dont want to use DataReader. </p>

"Kohana v3, automatically escape illegal characters?","<p>Quick question, does Kohana (version 3) automatically escape data that is passed into ORM::factory..... (and everywhere else that has to do with the database)?</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>$thread = ORM::factory('thread', $this-&gt;request-&gt;param('id'));

<p>Would the data passed in the second argument be auto-escaped before it goes in the SQL query or do I have to manually do it? Probably a stupid question and it's better to be safe than sorry, but yeah... I usually do manually escape the data, but I want to know if Kohana does this for me?</p>

    return [FBSession openActiveSessionWithReadPermissions:nil
                                          allowLoginUI:allowLoginUI
                                     completionHandler:^(FBSession *session,
                                                         FBSessionState state,
                                                         NSError *error) {
                                         [self sessionStateChanged:session
                                                             state:state
                                                             error:error];
                                     }];
}
</code></pre>

<p>Results in the following UIAlertView dialog message being displayed to the user:</p>

<pre><code>""App Name"" would like to access your basic profile info and list of friends.
</code></pre>

<p>As an end user, I would wonder why this app needs a list of my friends.  And actually, our app doesn't need a list of friends and would be concerned that the app would start spamming my friends (like so many apps really do that we give permissions to).</p>

<p>Again, pretending like I am an end user, after reluctantly giving privileges I go to a browser and access my Account Settings in Facebook and choose Apps.  Then I select the app I just gave access to.  It says the following:</p>

<p>This app needs:   </p>

<pre><code>  Your email address
  Your birthday
  Your location
</code></pre>

<p>Again, the app doesn't need those things.</p>

<p>On the same App Settings page in Facebook, it has a ""Last Data Access"" -> ""See Details"" option.  When I click that it says the following:</p>

<pre><code>Last Data Access
In the last 90 days, ""App Name"" accessed the following information on your behalf:
Basic Information
Education History, Current City and Work History
</code></pre>

<p>The plot thickens!  My app doesn't need Education History, Current City and Work History.</p>

<p>The reason this bothers me is that I believe users will turn down these access requests because they don't understand why my app needs all of these things.</p>

<p>How do I truly go after minimal privileges such that I can allow the user to post from our app about our app on their own wall?</p>

<p>Has anyone been able to do this successfully?</p>

"How to deal with the deprecated offline_access?","<p>I have an application which uses offline_access to get permanent access to different pages.</p>

<p>Users can install this application and add it to pages, where they are admins.
With an external Backend they can administrate their app and let it post different things (Competitions, ...).
So they don't have to stay logged in to Facebook.</p>

<p>Now... there is the problem...</p>

<p>On May 1st the offline_access permission will be removed and the customers have to get a new Token for their Pages every 60 days.</p>

<p>Since now I'm using the offline_access feature for our customers to get non-expiring Page-Tokens.</p>

<p>Is there any workaround for that?
Often it's just a Facebook sub-account of the customers to run the app. So it's possible that they don't login for 60+ days = the access token will expire and the application won't work.</p>

"How to like / share URLs inside Facebook that contain get-parameters","<p>We are working on a facebook-app with lots of dynamic pages. As the app is embedded in a tab on a facebook page, the urls contain a get-parameter to address the correct tab/app. We want to implement like- and send-buttons for several pages within our app, but facebook seems to dump all get-parameters from urls within facebook. As the result all like- and send-buttons point to the facebook-page itself instead of the tab.</p>

"I know I'm doing validation wrong. Please persuade me to stop :)","<p>First let me explain how I currently handle validation, say, for an IPv4 address:</p>

        this.value = value;
    }

    private static IPv4Address CheckSyntax(string value) {

    }

    public static implicit operator string(IPv4Address address) {
        return address.value;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I have a bunch of structs like this one.</p>

<p>They often have additional private members to handle things but not methods are exposed publicly.</p>

<p>Here is a sample usage:</p>

<pre><code>IPv4Address a;
IPv4Address b = ""1.2.3.4"";
a = b;
b = ""5.6.7.8"";

string address = a;

// c contains ""1.2.3.4""
IPv4Address c = address;

// See if it's valid
try {
    IPv4Address d = ""111.222.333.444"";
}
catch (ApplicationException e) {
    // Handle the exception...
}
</code></pre>

<p>I can feel that there's something very disturbing with this, hence I'm pondering about switching to a static class with methods like IsIPv4Address and so on.</p>

<p>Now, here's what I think is wrong with the approach above:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>New team members will have to wrap their heads around this</p></li>
<li><p>It might impede integration with 3rd party code</p></li>
<li><p>Exceptions are expensive</p></li>
<li><p>Never seen anything like this and I am a conservative type at heart :)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>And then what I like about it:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Very close to having a lot of specialized primitives since you have value types.</p></li>
<li><p>In practice they can be often used like primitive types would, for example it isn't a problem passing the struct above to a method that accepts a string.</p></li>
<li><p>And, my favourite, you can pass these structs between objects and be sure that they contain a syntactically valid value. This also avoids having to always check for correctness, which can be expensive if done unnecessarily and even forgotten.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I can't find a fatal flaw to the approach above (just a beginner here), what do you think?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> as you can infer from the first line this is only an example, I'm not asking for a way to validate an IP address.</p>

<p>How does one configure the Like button in this case, to individualize each item with its own Likes?</p>

<p>Do I need to use FBML or can it be done with the iframe embed?</p>

"Facebook like buttons erroneously handled as one","<p>I've implemented the like button on my WP blog, but for some reason some of them (not all of them) are interpreted as being the same button. If I press like, I will also like the ones that is interpreted as the same. I can't figure out why. There are several other problems with what is shared on Facebook, but I think those problems are connected to this one.</p>

<p>It worked great for a few days, then I started getting an error each time I pressed the like button. After fiddling with the og:type value the error disappeared, but instead now I get this strange behaviour.</p>

<p>My implementation is so simple, I can't really think of any causes:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class=""fb-like""&gt;&lt;fb:like href=""&lt;?php the_permalink();?&gt;"" show_faces=""true"" width=""600"" font=""arial""&gt;&lt;/fb:like&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I've found that the behaviour changes depending on what og:type I define in the header section, but with no value producing the correct result.</p>

<p>EDIT: Yes, I know about system wide setting about the number of lines for one notch of scroll. But in some applications this setting is interpreted related to size in pixels so scrolling is predictable, but for some like spreadsheet is not. Since the height of line in a cell differ depending of the cell content, with other setting as 1 you will have a guarantee of unpredictable content before your eyes with only one notch. </p>

"Put process into background in php while sending a data","<p>I've been creating a php script for downloading facebook user data.

"How do I derive from hashlib.sha256 in Python?","<p>A naive attempt fails miserably:</p>

<pre><code>import hashlib

class fred(hashlib.sha256):
    pass

-&gt; TypeError: Error when calling the metaclass bases
       cannot create 'builtin_function_or_method' instances
</code></pre>

<p>Well, it turns out that hashlib.sha256 is a callable, not a class.  Trying something a bit more creative doesn't work either:</p>

<pre><code> import hashlib

 class fred(type(hashlib.sha256())):
     pass

 f = fred

 -&gt; TypeError: cannot create 'fred' instances
</code></pre>

<p>Hmmm...</p>

<p>So, how do I do it?</p>

<p>Here is what I want to actually achieve:</p>

<pre><code>class shad_256(sha256):
    """"""Double SHA - sha256(sha256(data).digest())
Less susceptible to length extension attacks than sha256 alone.""""""
    def digest(self):

    def hexdigest(self):
        return sha256(sha256.digest(self)).hexdigest()
</code></pre>

<p>Basically I want everything to pass through except when someone calls for a result I want to insert an extra step of my own.  Is there a clever way I can accomplish this with <code>__new__</code> or metaclass magic of some sort?</p>

<p>I have a solution I'm largely happy with that I posted as an answer, but I'm really interested to see if anybody can think of anything better.  Either much less verbose with very little cost in readability or much faster (particularly when calling <code>update</code>) while still being somewhat readable.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I ran some tests:</p>

<pre><code># test_sha._timehash takes three parameters, the hash object generator to use,
# the number of updates and the size of the updates.

# Built in hashlib.sha256

I then thought it would be awesome if the text files lived in a shared Dropbox folder so that my staff can update the text files and then see their updates online without hacking any code or dealing with databases. It all works great on my local dev, but when I upload the code to my production server I run into problems. I think it's a Unix permissions problem, here is the PHP error:</p>

"Facebook Graph API not returning all events","<p>I'm using the Facebook Graph API, via the PHP SDK, to fetch a list of events attached to a Facebook page. The page has 15 events, all public; if I query them from the links in the developer documentation (i.e. with the sample access key it gives you there) I can see all fifteen of them.</p>

<p>That sample URL, the one that works fine, is:</p>

<pre><code>https://graph.facebook.com/[the name of the page]/events?access_token=[the access token]

<p>If, though, I do the same request via the PHP SDK — that is, from calling:</p>

<pre><code>$facebook = new Facebook(array(
    'appId' =&gt; $fb_app_id,
    'secret' =&gt; $fb_secret,
    'cookie' =&gt; true
));

$result = $facebook-&gt;api('[the name of the page]/events');

<p>…then it returns only nine events, not the full fifteen. I've tried seemingly every combination of parameters: I've tried <code>limit</code>ing it to 10, 15, 100, 500; I've tried setting various <code>offset</code>s; I've set either or both <code>since</code> and <code>until</code>. I've tried to think of all the gotchas: the events are definitely public, and show up if I visit the page's ""Events"" tab while logged out of Facebook. Whatever I do, I just get those same nine events, mocking me with their incompleteness.</p>

<p>Does anyone have any ideas? The events that aren't showing are the most recently added ones, if that makes any difference, though they were added to Facebook days — rather than hours or minutes — ago. I can't think why that would make a difference, though, and I've had events show up within minutes of being added before.</p>

"Copy and Paste a Row from Sheet1 Containing ""YES"" in Cell J to Sheet4 in Excel 2007","<p>I have been looking for an answer to this issue for several days by using google and various Excel troubleshooting sites.  Unfortunately, I am 100% unfamiliar with Macros in Excel and my training isn't until April (I am signed up though!).  Becuase I just don't understand the programming, I am having a hard time ""fixing"" solutions online to meet my needs.  I really need to have this specifically laid out for my situation.</p>

<p>I have a spreadsheet containing Sheet1 and Sheet4.  Sheet1 has data in columns A-L and can have unlimited rows.  When the value ""YES"" is entered in column J, I would like the macro to copy and paste that whole row into Sheet 4 in the next empty row.</p>

<p>Could anyone help?  This project must be completed by Monday, March 19.  Thank you!</p>

"Is it possible to export a SSRS report to Excel, with the report's chart as an Excel chart not an image?","<p>I have a simple bar chart in an SSRS 2008 R2 report which is rendered using the VS2008 ReportViewer control in my ASP.NET AJAX application.

"Should OAuth token be shared to implement SSO?","<p>What's a commonly accepted way of implementing SSO using a third party OAuth provider?</p>

<p>I have a server with user resources associated with server's user ID, the user ID also has a Facebook user ID associated. Would it be a good approach to authenticate a client to the server if the login was redirected to, say, Facebook where it would return an OAuth token and the token is then shared with the client?</p>

<p>Suppose SSL is implemented, the OAuth token would then act in the same way as a session cookie that gives permission to user resources on the server. </p>

<p>The same user an different client can then reauthenticate with Facebook which would return the same Facebook ID, which gives access to the same user's resources and a different OAuth token which expires independently and removing the app on Facebook can callback the server with a deauthenticate request to keep things synchronised. </p>

<p>Is this a good policy to use? Is it safe against attacks like session sidejacking, cross site reference etc?</p>

<p>On my app however I can open windows which contain images, and you can share the url of the image to facebook/twitter or what ever.</p>

<p>However these usually require on opening new windows, and or dont have return urls so once you share it, you just sit on the ""Post To Wall"" page, and cannot get back to my app.</p>

"Single account for multiple OAuth providers (Facebook, Google, Windows Live)?","<p>I have a web application that allows registration and authentication through <em>Facebook</em>, <em>Google</em> and <em>Windows Live</em>. Each OAuth request has the required scope to retrieve associated e-mail addresses from the authentication provider.</p>

<p><strong>The current situation</strong> is that an account is created based on the provider and the provided identifier. This means that if a user has <strong>logged in with multiple providers</strong> the user will have <strong>multiple accounts</strong> on the web application.</p>

<p>I want to have the <strong>ideal situation</strong> of having a <strong>single acccount</strong> even when using <strong>multiple providers</strong>. I was thinking about using the e-mail addresses to see if an account exists for the user. If it exists, use the account based on the e-mail address.</p>

<p>How safe/reliable is this? Do all OAuth providers mentioned validate e-mail addresses? Better ways?</p>

"Same absolute path on linux and windows 7","<p>I have windows 7 and ubuntu on dual-boot and I'm sharing the same firefox profile folder on both OSs, which is located on the windows partition (which is mounted on ubuntu startup automaticaly).
My problem is that I'm using the FEBE extension (which creates backups of my profile for recovery purposes) but it needs me to set a folder absolute path to tell it where the backup should be created so that, on windows, it doesn't allow a path without a letter and backslashes like ""c:\whatever"". But when I open firefox on linux, this path has no meaning and backups are not done.
Is there a way to have one absolute path that's understandable by both OSs? Even if it doesn't point to the same place on each OS?</p>

  console.log(d.height(),d[0].scrollHeight);
  d.height(d.height() - 1);
}
</code></pre>

<p>There's div with padding and overflow:auto. And in firefox there's strange behavior of div's scrollHeight value. When we set up the div's height smaller than it's original height, that's natural to expect that the scrollbar appears immediately and the scrollHeight value remains the same. Chrome suits theese expecatations but not firefox, the last one doesn't draw scrollbar, decreases bottom padding and scrollHeight when the deviation of the original height is smaller than div's padding.</p>

<p>Getting up and running with SQL has been very easy from a VS C# perspective, but beginning to understand the security risks and safeguards is not proving the same.</p>

<p>I allow for the windows authentication magic (which I will hopefully someday demystify) that the server does to prevent random people from querying the database.

"Facebook SDK 3.1 - Error validating access token","<p>I'm trying to transition my app to the new Facebook SDK 3.1 (with support for iOS6 authentication).</p>

<p>I had it working just fine, so I then decided to remove the app from my list of authorized apps on the FB web site in order to test that iOS would ask for permission again.</p>

<p>Now my first call to [FBRequest requestForMe] causes this error:</p>

<p>Response:
{""error"":{""message"":""Error validating access token: Session does not match current stored session. This may be because the user changed the password since the time the session was created or Facebook has changed the session for security reasons."",""type"":""OAuthException"",""code"":190,""error_subcode"":460}}</p>

<p>Some details:</p>

<p>I'm trying to open the session as follows :</p>

<pre><code>   [FBSession openActiveSessionWithReadPermissions:nil
                                       allowLoginUI:YES
                                  completionHandler:^(FBSession *session, FBSessionState state, NSError *error) {

                                           switch (state) {
                                               case FBSessionStateOpen:
                                                   [self presentPostOptions];
                                                   break;

                                               case FBSessionStateClosed:
                                               case FBSessionStateClosedLoginFailed:
                                                   [FBSession.activeSession closeAndClearTokenInformation];
                                                   break;

                                               default:
                                                   break;
                                           }
</code></pre>

<p>I then get called back in state FBSessionStateOpen (at this point iOS hasn't presented a request dialog, is that to be expected)? Facebook logs this:</p>

<p>2012-09-26 13:43:43.768 MyApp[2177:907] FBSDKLog: FBSession <strong>INVALID</strong> transition from FBSessionStateCreated to FBSessionStateClosed

2012-09-26 13:43:43.837 MyApp[2177:907] FBSDKLog: FBSession transition from FBSessionStateCreatedOpening to FBSessionStateOpen </p>

<p>Once the session is open, in presentPostOptions I do this:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)presentPostOptions
{    
    [[FBRequest requestForMe] startWithCompletionHandler:^(FBRequestConnection *connection, NSDictionary&lt;FBGraphUser&gt; *user, NSError *error) {
        if (!error) {
            self.usersName = user.name;
            self.usersID = user.id;

            [self getPages];
        }
        else
        {
            [self didFailWithError:error];
        }
    }];
}
</code></pre>

<p>Before the above completion block is called back, my main state handler block is called with a FBSessionStateClosed state. In the meantime, the Facebook SDK has logged the above error.</p>

<p>I can't find any way to reset the system; nor do I really understand the cause.</p>

"External Facebook connect site using multi friend invite, looses existing cakephp session","<p>I have a facebook connect site.  I am able to ""login"" to my site with the facebook api &amp; fbml.  I would like to give my users the ability to invite friends.  I am using the multi invite and the form shows up fine.</p>

<p>My problem is once the user either invites or cancels on the page, the request back to my application from facebook, causes a new session to be started.</p>

<p>In the appcontroller's beforeFilter, I have tried to use the facebook session id as my cakephp application's session id, and on return from facebook, use session_id($id) to force to use the user's existing session.  However, when session_start() is finally called, a new session id is assigned every time.</p>

<p>Anyone out there implemented cakephp connect website that uses the multi invite.</p>

"How Can I Securely Implement a Password-less Login Feature?","<p>Just posted a new plugin: <a href=""http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-qr-code-login/"" rel=""nofollow"">No More Passwords</a></p>

<p>I currently have it tagged beta because logging into a platform is a sensitive issue and I don't want to release something that may have security holes. So here's my query:</p>

<p>Is is secure?</p>

<p>I've done the following to ensure security:</p>

<ol>
<li>Username/password are never passed back and forth, only the unique
hash.</li>
<li>Hash is removed from the database once it’s used, old hashes that
haven’t been used can’t be unless the database is hacked, but then
you have bigger issues.</li>
<li>All database queries of the hash have been escaped to prevent XSS
attacks. </li>
<li>nonce added to ajax call.</li>
<li>nonce and confirmation added to on mobile end to prevent CSRF attack.</li>
</ol>

<p>Here I have a complete description of <a href=""http://www.jackreichert.com/2012/01/22/no-more-passwords-log-into-wordpress-using-a-qr-code/"" rel=""nofollow"">how it works</a>.</p>

          appId   : 129837912837129837128937, //fake id

     js.src = \""//connect.facebook.net/en_US/all.js\"";
     d.getElementsByTagName('head')[0].appendChild(js);
   }(document));
</code></pre>

<p>Problem reproduction:</p>

<p>1) Use logout link to logout from facebook within my site. Facebook.com also gets logged out. Fine so far. My site now has the user logged out.</p>

<p>2) The user at some point goes to facebook.com and logs in. He uses a cookie to maintain the session.</p>

<p>3) He then goes to my site directly on the link /page.php?5&amp;sdasda&amp;asdad or any other non-home page link and the page loads completely (apart from the FB login button that has some lag of 1-2secs max).</p>

<p>4) When FB login button loads eventually, the FB js detects that the user is already logged in facebook.com (sees the fb cookie obtained in step 2) so attempts to ""log"" him in by redirecting to the root (www.mydomain.com) and not refreshing the current page.</p>

<p>This is how my login button looks like: </p>

<p>The ASP.Net-Pages and Sharepoint Web Parts are directly accessing the business logic.</p>

I want to use annotations to specify if a method from the business layer can be called or not. Furthermore i want to hide some things in the ASP.Net Sites without an programmaticly if-clause.</p>

"Running Multiple Instances of Firefox","<p>I am running SysInternal's <a href=""http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/cc817881.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">Desktops 1.02</a> and FireFox 3.6.2. I have noticed that while I can have Internet Explorer 8 open in multiple virtual desktops, you can not do the same with Firefox. If you try you get the error message:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Firefox is already running, but is not
  responding. To open a new window, you
  must close the existing Firefox
  process, or restart your system.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I did a little digging around to work around this and came up with creating a second profile via the Firefox profile manager (accessed by starting Firefox with the ""-p"" switch). This unfortunately created a new problem which is my add-ons (of which I use many) do not stay synchronized between profiles. </p>

<p>Is there a better approach here?</p>

"Initiating a chat between two non facebook friend via a FB app","<p>I'm working on a FB app that does introductions, and I'm looking for a way to make the app to introduce and initiate a chat between two Facebook users who are <strong>not</strong> direct friends. </p>

<p>Since messages from non-friends aren't alerted/notified in the menu upper bar, I was wondering if there's another way to use the API to initiate a chat that the users will actually see (I have both users FB credentials).</p>

<p>I thought about using the request API but the redirect URL must be owned by the app so I cannot redirect to the FB messages.</p>

"Making client side authorization to Facebook using Javascript JQuery","<p>Here is what I want to:

I already registered my application in Facebook, and I have got my application secret keys (i did server side code, but I need more user friendy authorization system).</p>

<p>Based on response from Facebook, how can I get response code from Facebook without reloading the page? In case you didn't understand what I mean take a look on next example:</p>

"How do I get the login creditials passed to the JAX-WS service client with its associated policy sets and bindings in Rational/WebSphere tooling","<p>I am specifically using WebSphere Integration Developer V7, but I also could be using Rational Software Architect V 7.5.1 (as I have both).</p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> I am trying to create a JAX-WS client to call into the Human Task Manager and Business Flow Manager services in WebSphere Process Server V7, that are exposed via JAX-WS. By default they have attached Policy sets, and provider bindings that specify some WS-Security settings (as these are not defined in the WSDL).</p>

<p>I have figured out how to make it work using a Dynamic Web Project. I have been able to generate the JAX-WS client code from the WSDL. I have been able to export the policy sets and provider and client bindings from Process Server and import them into my workspace. I have been able to attach the policy set and client bindings to the client service. I have been able to set up a page and a servlet to invoke my web service (to test the client). And I have been able to set up the security settings in the deployment descriptors and websphere binding/extension files to get it work.</p>

<p>This is all wonderful, but in reality we don't want an ear with a war just to expose the web service client to our other applications we are writing. We want to generate a web service client jar and package it with other applications.</p>

<p>Given this line of thought I have been able to figure out how to use a regular Java Project in my IDE and generate the web service client into it. I have also been able to attach the policy set and client bindings to the client.</p>

<p><strong>My problem</strong> is now how to I invoke this?  I have created a dynamic web project with my page and servlet as before to test my client. I set up my client project as a web library dependency so it has access to the client code. I can even set up the deployment descriptors as before to force login and authenication. Only problem now is that I can't figure out how to pass the credentials to my web service now that it is in its own ""jar"". Before I had access to a menu to set up the TokenGenerator and CallbackHandler. Now, I don't have access to those menus as the client is not in the dynamic web project. So now I have a ""disconnect"" and it of course fails when trying to run it on the server.</p>

<p>There has to be a way to do this. I should be able to generate a client jar and pass it what it needs. Anyone encounter this before?</p>

"Excel: get cell value by defined name w/o knowing the sheet","<p>I'm using pywin32 to read and write to an Excel workbook with multiple sheets. I would like to access cell values by their defined names. I could use</p>

<pre><code>myWorkbook.Sheets(mySheet).Range(""myCellName"").Value
</code></pre>

<p>however, I don't always know what sheet the name is defined on. Right now, I work around that by using a range(sheet0, sheetx) to try every sheet.
There is another function I thought I could use, that is a workbook method</p>

<pre><code>myWorkbook.Names(""myCellName"").Value
</code></pre>

<p>but rather than returning the value that is stored in the cell ""myCellName"" it returns the sheet and cell reference of the cell, say </p>

<pre><code>u""='mySheet2'!$D$37""

<p>Is there a more elegant way to directly access the value of a defined name - cell without knowing what sheet it is on? </p>

"need help with implementing facebook's ""load more"" functionality on multiple pages","<p>if you don't know what i mean it's when u scroll down on facebook more content keeps loading</p>

<p>i'm building a music facebook iframe app that has multiple tabs / pages</p>

<ol>
<li><code>newest releases</code> has the newest released songs.</li>
<li><code>top singers</code> has the top 10 singers.</li>
<li><code>top songs</code> has the top songs.</li>
<li><code>favourites</code> has the user favourite singers.</li>
<li><code>playlists</code> has the user playlists.</li>
</ol>

<p>i want to implement this on all the tabs i can do this right now but i want to try doing this without hard code and multiple if's and switch statements.</p>

<p>what i need to send to php to get the content is</p>

<ol>
<li><p>the content type (new songs / top singers / top songs / favourites / playlists)</p></li>
<li><p>if the content is ordered by rank get the last item rank number and send it to php
if the content is ordered by id get the last item id and send it to php.</p></li>
<li><p>once i get the content type and the last item id or rank send them to php then i do a switch statement get the content from the database and send it back.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>i tried it with 2 tabs but i think it's just bad solution because it's to much code and it's not reusable to much code</p>

<pre><code>function load_more() {

// get the selected tab content type.
content_type = $('.selected').data('content');
// get the last_item.
switch(content_type) {
    case 'new_releases':
        // not ranking get the last_item id.
        var last = $('input.item_id').val();
        break;
    case 'ranking':
    // ranking get the focused nested tab content type.
        var content_type = $('.focus').data('content');
        var last_item = $('input.item_rank').val();
        break;

    default:
        content_type = null;
}

var content = {
  ""content_type"" : content_type,
  ""last_item""    : last_item
};

    // send to php.
    $.ajax({
        type: 'post',
        data: 'content_type=' + content.content_type + '&amp;last_item=' + last_item,
        cache: false,
        url: '/fbcanvas/core/loadmore.php',
        success: function(html) {
            if(html != false) {
                $('#wrapper').append(html);
            }
        }
    });




 } // end function


$(""#load_more"").click(function() {
   load_more();
   return false; 
});

<p>Is it possible to achieve something like this in Excel? The result does not have to look exactly like this, but has to show those two numbers in one graph and be easy to understand.</p>

"Possible to limit an EC2 key to just ec2-associate-address?","<p>I have a regular EC2 instance with an elastic IP.  The few times the instance has been stopped, I've just manually re-associated the IP with it via the AWS Management console.  I'm now thinking about migrating it to a spot instance, which means I want a way of automatically re-associating it the IP on startup if/when the machine is shutdown due to being priced out of the market.  How to achieve this is well described in numerous places (e.g <a href=""http://serverfault.com/a/316565/2111"">here</a>).</p>

<p>My question is:</p>

<p>Like many people with this problem, I'm wary of putting my AWS credentials file on the instance itself.  I have a vague memory of seeing something about it being possible to create additional keys with more limited permissions, but am having trouble finding any concrete details.  So: is it possible to create a key which I can happily put on the machine knowing it can be used for little more than an ec2-associate-instance (but not login to other instances, or generally running riot with my AWS account), and how would I actually achieve this ?</p>

"Firewall define program exceptions Group Policy not applying","<p>I updated my domain's default policy to add exceptions to the Windows Firewall, under</p>

<p>Administrative Templates &lt; Network &lt; Network Connection &lt; Windows Firewall &lt; Domain Profile</p>

<p>I changed Windows Firewall: Define program exceptions and added these 2 entries:</p>

<pre><code>%system32%\lsass.exe:*:enabled:lsass
%system32%\svchost.exe:*:enabled:svchost
</code></pre>

<p>However when I run GPupdate /force from my client machine and run</p>

<pre><code>netsh firewall show allowedprogram
</code></pre>

<p>I don't see either of these entries I added showing up on my exceptions. It's been probably half an hour since I updated the GP object so I assume it shouldn't be from just not waiting long enough to run gpupdate. Am I missing something? I've tried running rsop.msc but when I expand Administrative Templates in rsop it just stops responding after a while, or does it just take a while and I need to leave it alone?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> After running GPupdate /force I get the event information ""Security policy in the Group policy objects has been applied successfully.""</p>

<p>After waiting longer with RSOP I can view the Administrative Templates, it shows my settings that allow remote administration exception and remote desktop exception is enabled. However I don't see any entries for them in the firewall when I run the netsh command. Also I am still getting security failures reporting the lsass and svchost are looking for connections so it's not that just working correctly and for some reason not displaying from the netsh command.</p>

<p>Any one have any suggestions? This is causing my security log in the event viewer to fill up and on other workstations in my network that I have to manually clear the logs for regular users to be able to log into their system.</p>

<p><strong>Edit 8/4/2009</strong> - On further inspection it's actually not remote desktop/administration that's filling up my security log it's svchost loading dns cache: C:\WINDOWS\system32\svchost.exe -k NetworkService with the DLL c:\windows\system32\dnsrslvr.dll</p>

<p>I tried adding the dll itself to the allowed program list but that didn't seem to help and it doesn't let you add the svchost directly to the exception list.</p>

<p>Everything I find online points to this post: <a href=""http://www.eventid.net/display.asp?eventid=861&amp;eventno=4615&amp;source=Security&amp;phase=1"" rel=""nofollow"">Event ID 861 Source Security</a> which just isn't a solution since it involves svchost.</p>

<p>This post <a href=""http://x-security.blogspot.com/2009/05/event-id-861.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Event ID 861 Identify which services is running as a svchost</a> is exactly the same situation I have, however it mentions the solution is to disable the dnsclient which obviously isn't an option in a domain environment.</p>

<p>If that's the case why is it still filling my event viewer. It seems like there has been alot of people affected by this issue filling their security logs whether it's specifically for dnscache or other services, everything I've been finding people just automatically want to say virus/malware etc and no one has offered a solution other than just disable audit tracking or disable the firewall service from running.</p>

"excel vba global variable and concurrency","<p>I have a few questions about how global variables can be used in Excel VBA.</p>

<p>So my application uses an API object that's provided by a third party. Currently in all of the functions, we initialize this object and use it:</p>

<pre><code>function()
   Dim api as someApi
   api.dosth

end function
</code></pre>

<p>I'm just wondering, instead of initialize it every single time, can i just make it a global variable? like just declare it at the beginning and initialize it in the workbook_open function? If multiple functions are running at the same time and trying to use this shared api object, will it be a problem? Also just a general question about global variables: do all the modules share the variables? Or each module can only see the global variables declared in its own code? For example if I have module a and module b in the same workbook, and api object is declared in module a and initialized in the workbook_open event, can the functions in module b use it or not?</p>

As soon as I paste the data I get a fairly useless error message saying ""Excel as stopped working"", Windows then takes a couple minutes to look for a solution, create a recovery file (which never works) and restart Excel.

"SSL web enabled embedded device","<p>For an embedded device under development we have a requirement for logging in to its web without sending user credentials in clear text.</p>

<p>The look of the log in form should be customizable, so digest authentication is not possible. The only remaining option as we see it, is to use HTTPS with SSL.</p>

<p>The device is usually accessed from the local network by it's IP address, but could also be made accessible from the internet.</p>

<p>My question is: Is it at all possible to prevent the ""Could not be certified"" browser warning,  when no DNS name is assigned to the locally accessed device? As I see it, a SSL certificate must be bound to a DNS name and certified at a Certificate Authority for the browser to fully accept the certificate.</p>

<p>I am fully aware of the fact that without a certified certification the browser can not authenticate the web server, which could lead to a ""man-in-the-middle"" attack.</p>

<p>When the device is fully configured it's only accessed very rarely, but it should be easily accessible.</p>

"Using Facebook C# SDK to post to page","<p>I've been using the Facebook C# SDK for sometime now, but have a really old version and am still using the REST API (I think). I'm just concerned with using the API to post to my own Facebook page (I have a WCMS plugin that posts content to our institution's Facebook page). I was wondering if anyone knew of a good tutorial on how to get this setup with the latest version of the SDK? I'm also concerned with how this is going to work when offline_access goes away so any thoughts on that would be appreciated as well. I'd rather not have to go in an manually get a new access token every 60 days. This seems somewhat unnecessary since the app I'm using to do the posting is in the same FB account as the page I'm trying to post to.</p>

"Posting to Facebook on behalf of the user: how to handle token expiration?","<p>I'm implementing a connect with Facebook/Twitter/... functionality on a website. The idea is that once a user connects his account with the external services our website could post messages on behalf of the user.</p>

<p>With Twitter there is no problem as the OAuth access_token doesn't expire. But with FB it does expire every two months, when the user logouts, changes password or explictly deauthorizes the app.</p>

<p>How should I handle the token expiration? For me it would be ideal if I could refresh the token automatically without bothering the user, but unless I've missed something it seems there isn't any way of doing this. So, right now I've two ideas:</p>

<ul>
<li>The less akward way: every time the user logins to the website check if the tokens have expired and notify the user that she has too reauthorize the app.</li>
<li>The more akward way: every time the ""post to social networks"" event triggers in our website, check if the tokens have expired and ask the user to reauthorize.</li>
</ul>

<p>The first option would be easier to implement and cleaner to the user. </p>

<p>So, how are you handling this situations?</p>

"Change response timeout setting (Firefox/Dojo)","<p>We have a system that uses Firefox as a client for a Web application. The web page uses Dojo Ajax to perform a servlet POST request doing a long process. The problem is when the request exceeds 15 minutes (based on observation), the same Http request (same parameters) is performed repeatedly by the browser. The repeat request is received every 1 minute 20 seconds thereafter. </p>

<pre><code>11:00:00 First Request
11:15:00 Repeat Request
11:16:20 Repeat Request
11:17:40 Repeat Request
11:19:00 Repeat Request
11:20:20 Repeat Request

<p>My question is there a setting in the firefox config or even on the servlet part that can prevent the repeat request? This is a local system so I can control the browser settings. </p>

<p>Note: I know that a solution to this is to perform the long process in a thread and repeatedly poll the thread via javascript but my boss wants an easier fix if possible via settings in firefox.</p>

The code used is the dojo toolkit dojo.xhrPost API to do the request. I am not sure if the dojo API is the one that is doing the reposting. Help from dojo expert too.</p>

"problems with 'mask' in firefox","<p>I'm at the end of my rope here. This 'mask' should work right? Well, I'm beginning to doubt. My example is at <code>http://50.63.191.172/mask.html</code>.</p>

<p>I really don't know what else I could try. I do have some constraints:</p>

<ol>
<li>I would like to have the svg external to any html page / css stylesheet because it will be used from multiple places.</li>
<li>I would like to have svg non size predetermined, because I don't want to have multiple versions for various sizes; there should be only one, so that it can be cached by browsers.</li>
<li>I can't have the image specified <em>inside</em> the svg. The svg is a styling to be applied to any potential image.</li>
</ol>

<p>I've tried multiple ways to make this work but no luck so far. It works just fine in Chrome/Safari using their '-webkit-mask' property. I've had ""some"" success with firefox and 'mask' if I specify the width and height of the masking rect in absolute pixels, but not as 100%. Is what I want even doable (an auto-scaling mask in firefox)? If yes, what am I missing?</p>

<p>The frustrating part, sometimes if I keep reloading the page, the images appear unmasked, only to be wiped off immediately after finish displaying.</p>

<p>Here's my svg:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;svg version=""1.1"" xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/2000/svg""
     xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink""&gt;

  &lt;mask id=""c1""&gt;
   &lt;g id=""group""&gt;
     &lt;linearGradient id=""g"" gradientUnits=""objectBoundingBox"" x2=""0"" y2=""1""&gt;
       &lt;stop stop-color=""white"" offset=""0""/&gt;
       &lt;stop stop-color=""white"" stop-opacity=""0"" offset=""1""/&gt;
     &lt;/linearGradient&gt;
     &lt;rect x=""0"" y=""0"" width=""100%"" height=""100%"" fill=""url(#g)"" /&gt;

"Python Mechanize does not list all forms?","<p>I've been writing a program to log in to Facebook and update the status as a side project. I managed to get the program to login. However, I'm having trouble selecting the textarea that ends up being the ""Enter your status here"" box. Using ""Inspect Element"" in Chrome, I'm able to see the form under which it's located, but listing the forms in the program doesn't seem to list said form...</p>

<pre><code>import mechanize
import re

br = mechanize.Browser()
usernamecorrect = 0
while usernamecorrect == 0:
    username = raw_input(""What is the username for your Facebook Account? "")
    matchmail = re.search(r'[\w.-]+@[\w.-]+', username)
    if matchmail:
        print matchmail.group()
        usernamecorrect = 1
    else:
        print ""That is not a valid username; please enter the e-mail address registered with your account.\n""
password = raw_input(""What is the password for your account?"")
print ""Logging in...""
br.set_handle_robots(False)
br.open(""https://www.facebook.com/"")
br.select_form(nr = 0)
br['email'] = username
br['pass'] = password
br.submit()
raw_input(""Login successful!"")
print ""Forms: \n""
for f in br.forms():
    print f.name
</code></pre>

<p>The full output is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>What is the username for your Facebook Account? myemail@website.com
What is the password for your account? thisisapassword
Logging in...
Login successful!
Forms:

navSearch
None
</code></pre>

<p>I took a look through the source of Facebook via Inspect Elements again, and ""navSearch"" is the ""Find People, things, etc."" search bar, and the unnamed form appears to have to do with the logout button. However, while Inspect Elements gives at least 2 more forms, one of which holds the status update box. I haven't been able to determine if it's because of JavaScript or not (while the status update box code block is encapsulated in  , so are the navSearch and logout forms.) The most relevant thing I've been able to find is that navSearch and the logout forms are in a separate div, but I somehow feel as though that shouldn't be much of a problem for mechanize. Is there just something wrong with my code, or is it something else entirely?</p>

"Security for requesting temporary logins","<p>I need to set up a system which will allow developers to request an emergency ID for a database.

<p>I don't want the application account to be highly privileged in every DB, so I created another account which will go into every db and have <code>db_owner</code>.  Evidently the <code>sp_addrolemember</code> using fixed db roles needs a db_owner to work, which is why the acct is <code>db_owner</code>.  I'd prefer security admin, but it seems it's not possible.</p>

<p>Back to the problem - using EXECUTE AS with dynamic code does not work.    </p>

<p>Is the only way to get this done by creating a stored procedure in every database which creates the user?</p>

<p>We're doing this because we'd like to crank down security on this server and take away db_owner from developers which has been the norm for years.  Creating this mechanism will satisfy their only remaining complaint about not having access.  They are afraid we won't answer a page and they will be unable to resolve an issue, so this will take care of that.</p>

<p>Of course, any advice on security holes here would be appreciated as well.</p>

"Single Page loads all Reports from Reporting Services - Security and Performance issues?","<p>I am migrating an extensive set of reports from classic asp web application into Reporting Services, and I've hit an interesting design issue.</p>

<p>My planned architecture consists of an IIS application server running a Classic ASP application and a database server running  SQL Server 2008 Reporting Services.  The basic problem is maintaining security during the transition from the asp application to the reports in SSRS.  The asp application collects information from the user and generates parameters which it will then post to the Report Server.  This setup would require that the Report Server accept anonymous requests for Reports, essentially defeating the built in Active Directory security.</p>

<p><strong>This means a malicious user could create his own html page with his own report parameters and post to my Report Server</strong>, allowing him complete access into the data in my database.  As it stands this architecture would result in a pretty significant security breach.</p>

<p>My classic ASP already defines user accounts and roles, so I'd like to use those accounts to restrict access to the reports.  My plan is to add a .NET application to my application server which load reports for the user using the Report Viewer control.  The user session can be transferred securely from classic asp to asp.net in <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/133173/classic-asp-and-asp-net-integration"">a number of ways</a>.  Then the Report Viewer can authenticate against the Report Server using the ASP.NET process account.</p>

<p>This design however, results in all of my users being routed to a single page for all of the reports in the system.  Will this result in a performance hit to the website?  It seems like the performance gain I get from moving all the reports into SSRS will be lost if I then serve them all up through the IIS app server.  And I'm not sure what the effect will be if 90% of my web traffic gets routed down to one asp.net page.</p>

<p>Are these legitimate concerns?  Am I going about this all wrong?</p>

<p>However, the application uses a .DLL with the Data Access Layer which is connecting to SQL Server 2000.

<p>Both the WinForms app and .DLL code properly recognize My.User.CurrentPrincipal.Identity as the account logged in to the app, not Windows. It's just not propagating to SQL Server. This is evidenced by Stored procedures writing SUSER_SNAME() to a table's column in T-SQL.</p>

<p>Can anyone see what I'm going wrong?</p>

"One-Way Permutations without Trapdoor","<p><strong>In Short:</strong> Assuming <strong>one-way permutations</strong> exist, can we construct one that has no trapdoor?</p>

<h3>More info:</h3>

<p>A one-way permutation is a permutation $\pi$ which is easy to compute, but hard to invert (see the <a href=""http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/tags/one-way-function/info"">one-way-function tag wiki</a> for a more formal definition). We usually consider <strong>families</strong> of one-way permutation, $\pi = \{\pi_n\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$, where each $\pi_n$ is a one-way permutation, acting on a <strong>finite</strong> domain $D_n$. A <strong>trapdoor</strong> one-way permutation is defined as above, except that there exists a trapdoor set $\{t_n\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ and an poly-time inverting algorithm $I$, such that for all $n$, $|t_n| \le {\rm poly}(n)$, and $I$ can invert $\pi_n$ provided that it is given $t_n$.</p>

<p>I know one-way permutations which are generated so that it is <em>infeasible</em> to find the trapdoor (yet the trapdoor exists). An example, based on RSA-assumption, is given <a href=""http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~oded/PS/gln.ps"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>. The question is, </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Do there exist (families of) one-way permutations which <strong>do not</strong> have a trapdoor (set)?</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Edit: (More Formalization)</h3>

<p>Assume there exists some one-way permutation $\pi$ with (infinite) domain $D \subseteq \{0,1\}^*$. That is, there exists a probabilistic polynomial-time algorithm $\mathcal{D}$ (which, on input $1^n$, induces some distribution over $D_n=\{0,1\}^n \cap D$), such that
for any polynomial-time adversary $\mathcal{A}$, any $c&gt;0$, and all sufficiently large integer $n$:</p>

<p>$\Pr[x \leftarrow \mathcal{D}(1^n) \colon \quad \mathcal{A}(\pi(x))=x]&lt;n^{-c}$
</p>

<p>(The probability is taken over the internal coin tosses of $\mathcal{D}$ and $\mathcal{A}$.)</p>

<p>The question, is whether we can construct a one-way permutation $\pi&#39;$, for which there exists a probabilistic polynomial-time algorithm $\mathcal{D}&#39;$ such that for any <strong>poly-size family of circuits</strong> $\mathcal{A}&#39;=\{\mathcal{A}&#39;_n\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$, any $c&gt;0$, and all sufficiently large integer $n$:</p>

<p>$\Pr[x \leftarrow \mathcal{D}&#39;(1^n) \colon \quad \mathcal{A}&#39;_n(\pi&#39;(x))=x]&lt;n^{-c}$
</p>

<p>(The probability is taken over the internal coin tosses of $\mathcal{D}&#39;$, since $\mathcal{A}&#39;$ is deterministic.)</p>

"Is Excel Shape.TextFrame.Characters.Insert broken on Excel 2007?","<p>I've got this piece of code I've been using Excel 2003 which mimics a solution given on the Microsoft website from a while back. How to add more than 255 characters to a shape's text frame:</p>

<pre><code>For i = 0 To Int(Len(myTxt) / 255)
    .Characters(.Characters.Count + 1).Insert Mid(myTxt, (i * 255) + 1, 255)
Next i
</code></pre>

<p>This just doesn't work under Excel 2007. There are two problems.</p>

<ol>
<li>Insert can't insert at the end of the field, it has insert at an existing character. So <code>.Characters(.Character.Count).Insert</code> will work, even though it's not what I want to do.</li>
<li>It's operating as an overwrite, not an insert. Wherever I apply Insert it overwrites the existing characters. So an Insert at <code>(.Character.Count)</code> will delete the final character.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now I've built in logic to operate differently depending on the version of Excel you're using. But I couldn't find anything relating to this issue. Is it a known bug? Is there a way to fix this behaviour?</p>

<p>(On a related note, I cannot set <code>.Characters(x,y).Font.Underline</code> = True either.)</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong> In my particular example, the code above is contained with something like <code>With myWorksheet.Shapes(1)</code> where the shape is a text box. It already has text inside it and I need to append <code>myTxt</code> (a <code>string</code> longer than 255 characters) to it. This code worked without problem on Excel 2003.

"How can I protect credentials that are part of a message payload?","<p>We're using a messaging queue (JMS / ActiveMQ) in an application that is facilitating communication between client applications and a server application. The username and password for the user trying to call the server application are sent from the client as part of each message that is sent to the queue. We want to protect user credentials (at least the password) in the following ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>They are not visible when the message payload is printed to log files</li>
<li>They are not visible when administrators look at the messages in an administrative console that let's them look at the contents of a queue</li>
<li>Nobody can create a new message using the credentials from an intercepted message (even if it is masked/hashed/encrypted).</li>
</ul>

<p>Simply masking the password on the client side and unmasking it on the server side would be insufficient, because someone could intercept the masked password from the log files or the administrative console, create a new message with malicious data, then send the malicious message which would be unmasked and executed on the server side. The same problem would exist using a secure channel between the client and message queue, since the administrative console would still expose the password (masked or not).</p>

"Running App on Clients Machine -> Oldeb Jet 12.0 is not registered","<p>Ive seen many solutions to this issue, which is apparently based on compiling on a 64 bit machine (which i am) and runing the app on a 32 bit machine (which i am).  compiling in x86 mode does not help. What i do is a try catch: 
When opening an excel file i simply do a try catch on the 12.0 provider. If 12 fails then i resort to 4.0 and that works!</p>

<p>However the issue continues for the follwing code: </p>

<p>Depending on a configuration parameter the SSLContext is initialized for <code>SSLv3</code>. Meaning that if the parameter is not set it is <code>SSLv3</code>, otherwise it is <code>TLS</code>.</p>

<p>I noticed some handshake failures occasionally and traced it: If the client negotiated TLS and the server replied with <code>SSLv3</code>, the handshake failed</p>

<p>Why does this happen? I thought that TLS and SSLv3 are pretty much interchangeable.
Are they not? If I change server side to always reply <code>TLS</code> is there a chance I will break something?</p>

"Accessing checkboxes with faces when using Facebook ""send"" button","<p>I've messed around with FBML (deprecated, I know) and the newer HTML5 code to no end, but so far I haven't found any way to do what I'm looking to do.</p>

<p>When using ""apprequest"" within an application on Facebook (within iframe), I can allow users to share requests to join the app, but those messages that get sent are very hidden away. They don't seem to appear in the newsfeed for shared recipients, and we're afraid users won't see the request from their friends.</p>

<p>Instead, we thought we'd allow users to alternatively share to their friends with the ""send"" button code that Facebook offers up. This allows us to specify a URL (we were thinking the app canvas URL or page tab it would live on).</p>

<p>So far, this is all I could generate...</p>

<p>For illustration purposes:
Let Class1 be the class to be converted to an Xml string. (Notice that I removed the xml declaration at the start of the string to avoid having the preamble present- non printable character)<br>

<p>Class1 myClass = new Class1();<br>
this class is converted to a string s. s= ConvertObjectToXmlString(myClass);<br>
then s is assigned to a cell<br>
Range r = Application.ActiveCell;<br>
r.Value2 = s;</p>

<p>Note:
(1) If the string is too big,  I limit it to 32000 chars and split the string in chunks of 32000 chars and save the chunks in multiple cells.<br>
(2) I do not to quote the string before adding to a cell. Do I need to? If so how it can be done?<br>

<p>So, the question is, where should I stash this data?  Its very rarely accessed, but when it is ALL of it is.  Additionally, it'd be nice if the data <strong>doesn't</strong> persist beyond the current session; stale data is useless in this case, and I'd rather not fill up disk needlessly.</p>

"Excel: Charting date, time elapsed, and another value","<p>I'm trying to chart growth in our nightly backups. The three values I'm using are the date of the backup, the backup job size in bytes, and the time the job took to completely in hh:mm:ss.</p>

<p>Using Excel 2010, I'm having a devil of a time convincing Excel that the elapsed time is a number of hours, minutes, and seconds, and not a time of day.</p>

<p>I've tried using Time formats, and a few custom formats that appear not to use an AM/PM value, but all to no avail. The values are still firmly showing an AM/PM in the function box.</p>

<p>I also tried removing all "" AM"" from the spreadsheet after setting the format to one of these AM/PM-less formats. No difference, the AM/PM's are still there.</p>

<p>Once I can cajole Excel into accepting the values for what I want them to be and not what it thinks they ought to be, I'd like to chart them using two vertical axis': One for the job size and one for job time. The horizontal axis would be job date. This should allow me to graphically represent the growth of data we backup and the time it takes to backup that data and compare these values relatively.</p>

<p>UPDATE clarifying based on first response:</p>

<p>It is not important to me how the data is displayed. What is important to me is that the data I enter reflects correctly what it is that data truly is.</p>

<p>For a value entered of 6:03:23, I do not mean the value represet 3 minutes and 23 seconds after 6 o'clock in the morning. That value should reprsent 6 hours, 3 minutes, and 23 seconds of time, regardless of where or when that period originated. It is a measurement, not a reference point.</p>

<p>Excel seems to think I am refering to the reference point of time on the clock, not to a measurement of time that has elapsed during a process.</p>

<p>So long as Excel thinks I'm refering to a point of time and not a measured chunk of it, it will not be able to recognize what it is I am comparing and this will not graph it appropriately.</p>

<p>The content of my post itself is unmolested, but the link now points to the www subdomain.

<p>Our application server should be splitted into set of services. Also we need to implement something like security service with Login and Logout methods.

"Tricky question for good understanding of CSRF","<p>My friend and I have a pari for beer.</p>

<p>From wikipedia:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Requiring a secret, user-specific
  token in all form submissions and
  side-effect URLs prevents CSRF; the
  attacker's site cannot put the right
  token in its submissions</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The atacker can use browser cookies indirectly, but he can't use them directly!
That's why he can't put the cookies into the link using <code>document.write()</code></p>

<p>Let us look how the logout link is generated. Is it secure way? Can this GET request be faked?</p>

<pre><code>function logout(){
     echo '&lt;a href=""?action=logout&amp;sid='.htmlspecialchars($_COOKIE['sid']).'&gt;Logout&lt;/a&gt;';

<p><strong>sid</strong> is a session ID, generated for every session</p>

<p>on the server side, the following checking is performed:</p>

"How to import a random cell-data from a column into an userform","<p>I am creating a quiz-game with vba and excel and could use any advice I can get, because I am very new to Virtual Basic. The Layout is very much done and I will of course send it to you if you would be interested.</p>

<p>Here is my problem though:
I have 2 columns with about 700 cells. In the first one are street names and in the second one their respective districts of my hometown. I need some kind of code, that randomly selects one district (out of column B) and puts it in the caption of a label the user form.</p>

<p>Then there are 4 checkboxes wich need their caption changed to random street names from column A.</p>

<p>And finally: After the player hit the checkboxes of the streets, which he believes belong to the district given in the label and presses a button - the program should award him with either 5 points, if he guessed all answers correct. 2 points if he checked for example 2 out of 3 correct. Or 0 if he was totally wrong.</p>

<p>I really almost mad right now because I can't imagine a way to solve this.</p>

<p>Any help is greatly appreciated and I am very grateful in advance.
Apologies for my bad english :S</p>

"Securing a login system without passwords","<p>I'm developing a mobile application for a company. Everyone at the company has an @company.com email address. The app itself is confidential, so it will only be installed on employees' devices. This app communicates with an external server to store and retrieve data.</p>

<p>Ideally what I would like to accomplish is to let people log in to the app by just providing their email address, without a password. Here is my current thinking:</p>

<ol>
<li>A new user opens the app for the first time on a certain device and puts in their email address. The email address is sent to the server, along with a static token embedded in the application (which is the same for all instances of the application).</li>
<li>The server verifies the token and the fact that the email address is @company.com. It responds with a new token/key for use only with that user and device, which the client stores in plain text locally. That key is effectively the user's password. It is hashed, stored in the server database, and marked as disabled.</li>
<li>There are two possibilities at this point:
<ol>
<li>The server sends an email to that address confirming that they want to log in on a new device. The email contains a link which, when clicked, marks the key as enabled. There would need to be rate-limiting on new device requests so people can't get spammed if someone discovers the token embedded in the app.</li>
<li>An administrator specifically approves new device requests.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Every subsequent client request to the server must include the key.</li>
</ol>

<p>Assuming all communication is over SSL, does this sound like a secure strategy? Is there a more secure or simpler approach?</p>

<p>Additionally, what is the best way to generate the token that will be stored client-side? Since I want users to only put in their email address the first time they use the app, I believe that this token will never change. Here is my current algorithm (PHP) loosely based on Drupal's drupal_get_token():</p>

<pre><code>// Usage: get_token($email) or get_token($client_token)
function get_token($value = '') {
  $salt = hash('sha256', 'Some static, predefined phrase');
  $hmac = base64_encode(hash_hmac('sha256', $email, $salt, TRUE));
  return $hmac;
}
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see it doesn't protect against parallel attacks (e.g. if someone figured out the predefined phrase and algorithm and they had access to the database, they could generate hashes and compare them against the ones stored in the database) but because the original key value is already long I don't think this would be nearly as effective as it would be against normal passwords. Additionally I am not sure of a way to create a dynamic salt that an attacker would not already have access to if they could access the database (or honestly if it would even matter at that point, since getting access to the database would expose the data we're trying to keep confidential anyway).</p>

<p>I though this was unusual since the comments box on that page certainly had comments, but were not appearing on the Graph API call.</p>

<p>I tried doing the same using the Graph API Explorer tool, with the same results.</p>

<p>Thinking it might be an issue with the Graph API, I tried to query the comments out with FQL and the PHP API by setting a new Facebook Object and runnign a query as follows.</p>

<pre><code>SELECT post_fbid, fromid, object_id, text, time FROM comment WHERE object_id IN (SELECT comments_fbid FROM link_stat WHERE url ='{YOUR_URL}')

<p>Once again with the same results, a empty array.</p>

<p>I tried ckecking for likes as well, with the same results, an empty array.</p>

<p>Tried encoding the URL and placing that on both the API call and the FQL request, the same results.</p>

<p>I see that there are facebook comments on the pages, but I am not able to obtain them through the Graph API or a FQL query.</p>

<p>Has anyone else come across this issue and did you find a way to get your comments out. Any ideas would be appreciated.</p>

<p>What could I do (on the server side) to increase security regarding this OpenVPN server? Here are some of my ideas:</p>

<ol>
<li>I <code>sed 's/1194/50000/'</code> the port number to a higher one to make it harder for port scanners to find</li>
<li>iptables? I should only allow IP ranges [on the input chain] that I will use in reality? +Only allow my laptop's MAC address<br></li>
<li>If I don't use my router (e.g.: when I'm sleeping) I just turn it off.</li>
</ol>

<p>Is there anything I'm missing? From the <code>ps</code> command I can see that OpenVPN is run by root, which is unsafe. What else should I do to increase security?</p>

"Facebook Message API Anomaly","<p>i have a disturbing question inside my head. 
I'm using Blackberry and Android, and i did install the Facebook apps. Then I think when we want to use Facebook API to send a message, the only way is using Dialog Box whether via popup, iframe, or whatever. I've compared my Facebook apps and The API, when I'm using the Facebok Application on Blackberry or Android to send message, it no needs the dialog, it sends automatically. We realized that the Facebook Apps on my Blackberry is just an application, and so does it use Facebook API. How could it be ? and Does it indicates that we can use the Facebook Send Message API without any Dialog ? Thanks .</p>

"Excel 2007 shadow copy?","<p>My question is about Excel add-ins and VBA code.</p>

<p>This is the situation: </p>

<p>There are 2 Excel files; one is just a normal Excel sheet, one is a .xla add-in with VBA code which is stored on a network drive.</p>

<p>In the normal Excel sheet is a reference to the .xla file so that the sheet can use the macros from the .xla file. This works fine so far, but sometimes there seems to be a bug: It looks likes the sheet uses some kind of ""shadow copy"" of the .xla file.
The bug occurs when I change code in the VBA editor or I set a breakpoint, both are ignored when running the macro. It feels like there is a old copy of the .xla file, which is invisible and which is somehow stored in the normal Excel file, so the code running is not the macro I see in the editor.</p>

<p>I think this problem has occurred since I installed MS Office 2007.</p>

<p>I hope someone can help me.</p>

<p>then i tried implementing it, here is my code.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;html class=""local_en_US"" xmlns:music=""http://ogp.me/ns/music#"" xmlns:og=""http://ogp.me/ns#""&gt;

&lt;meta property=""og:type"" content=""music.song"" /&gt;
&lt;meta property=""music:musician"" content=""http://testappwebsite.dyndns-office.com/artist/sarya-al-sawas/"" /&gt;
&lt;meta property=""music:duration"" content=""619"" /&gt;
&lt;meta property=""og:image"" content=""http://testappwebsite.dyndns-office.com/m/pics/artists/l.4eeea466d2fe79.75675583.jpg"" /&gt;
&lt;meta property=""og:url"" content=""http://testappwebsite.dyndns-office.com/track/sarya-al-sawas-mnalbortom-al-ta7tani/"" /&gt;
&lt;meta property=""og:site_name"" content=""BeatBase"" /&gt;
&lt;meta property=""fb:app_id"" content=""135615343218651"" /&gt;
&lt;meta property=""og:audio"" content=""http://testappwebsite.dyndns-office.com/m/tracks/t.4eef1d812c56f8.45560770.mp3"" /&gt;
&lt;meta property=""og:audio:type"" content=""audio/vnd.facebook.bridge"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Then i tried sharing the url on my status to test, and i didnt get any play button.
i went to debug.</p>

<p>by the way the last 4 hours went for searching the web for clues.</p>

<p>i found some.</p>

"How can I copy a formula multiple times and always refer to the same cell?","<p>I have a number in cell A1 and a column of 20 numbers in the B column.</p>

<p>I'd like to put a formula in each of the cells in the C column next to each number in the B column. Let's say it's <code>=B1-A1</code>, and then the next one would be <code>=B2-A1</code>, then <code>=B3-A1</code>, etc.</p>

<p>I could type all that in by hand, but it would take a long time. Is there a way I can copy the first formula, which is in cell C1, and paste it into the following cells in the C column?</p>

<p>I tried it, but I would get, say, <code>=B5-A5</code> instead of <code>=B5-A1</code>.</p>

<p>I'm trying to do this in OpenOffice, but I suspect the answer would be similar for Excel.</p>

"Spring-security split authentication and the authorization","<p>I'm trying to create a custom login for my flex web app with spring-security.
I have an working version where we use the channelset.login with blazeds.</p>

<p>The problem i have is that i would like to split the authentication and the authorization.</p>

<p>I would like to ask the user to make some choices after the authentication to determine its roles.</p>

<p>Since the roles the user is authorized to are determined by this choices.</p>

<p>This means the user has to be authenticated and then the client needs to do a service call to the service and then the authorization process needs to take place.</p>

<p>Does anyone know if this is possible and have some tips of how this can be done?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance,</p>

"Spring Security CAS implementation in web service","<p>Our team has been tasked with securing a web service somehow, now we have other web application that are secured with SpringSecurity CAS, and we were thinking that it would work to secure the web service with this as well. The thought being that if the user signs into one of the web applications through the CAS server, when the web service is called it will see that that user is already authenticated and allow them to utilize it. We aren't really sure if this is the correct way of doing this as there was a lot of talk about using HMAC or Oauth 2.0, but thought of CAS because that is what everything else is using.</p>

<p>I'm sorry this is so long, but I just wanted to put as much out there as possible.</p>

<p>As @smp7d pointed out CAS might not be the best case for this. I found this,</p>

<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1141008/securing-rest-and-json"">Securing REST and JSON</a> </p>

<p>which is exactly what this web service is, RESTful and serving up JSON, it is going to be hosted internally and only accessible internally. Now I guess the question has moved from using CAS, to what should we go with, what is the standard?</p>

"User Details Management","<p>I have in my web application a role called ""Administrator"". Users who have this role should be able to modify the information about the registered users.</p>

<p>I am thinking about displaying a table with the user details such as e-mail, username, and be able to change them but I don't know what should I do if a users comes to the office physically, goes to an admin and asks for a password change (yes they can do that). Should the admin just press a reset button over the row and tell the user to check his e-mail when he arrives home and proceed with the recovery? (reset link for example) Or should the administrator reset the user's password and give him his new password in that very moment? The second approach is preferable as I was asked to do that...</p>

"Website flickers when navigating on pages with the same bg - FFX & IE","<p>Here you can test the website i'm currently working on:
<a href=""http://www.whateverxpress.com/wx_site/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.whateverxpress.com/wx_site/</a></p>

<p>When you navigate trough the website sections you'll get a nasty flicker on firefox and IE, i don't have this issue on chrome anymore, but i did have it until i changed the swf object background from opaque to transparent. So thought it could be an swf object bug, but i tried removing all the js coding and flash animations and the same prevails. So Even with the html &amp; css alone i'm getting this issue on ff (10.0.2) - nightly 13.0a1 - IE 9 (The flicker won't show on IE 8).</p>

<p>The cache is configured on the htaccess like this:</p>

<pre><code>ExpiresActive On
ExpiresByType image/png ""access plus 5 hour""
ExpiresByType image/jpg ""access plus 5 hour""
ExpiresByType text/css ""access plus 5 hour""
ExpiresByType text/html ""access plus 5 hour""
ExpiresByType application/x-shockwave-flash ""access plus 5 hour""
ExpiresByType application/javascript ""access plus 5 hour""

FileETag none
</code></pre>

<p>Not sure if telling it to cache for a year will make a difference, since i tested on the 5 hours range...</p>

<p>I got this css code to load the background picture :</p>

<pre><code>#wrapper {
width:816px;
height:921px;
margin:auto;
background:url(img/wx_base_optimized5.jpg) no-repeat;}
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see is a big image but i didn't thought it would cause this nasty issue.</p>

<p>I've been reading on many sites for the past five days and i found nothing to solve this issue, so you guys are my last hope. I'll thank you on advance for reading this much, i hope you could help me out.</p>

<p>P.S: Around once on 15 tries it shows correctly on nightly, not sure why.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong>
I fixed the flickering. I removed the main background jpg and to my surprise the flickering was still present, so i figured it was something else causing it. Disabling parts of my css rules i found that the "".stripped_box"" which had another picture on it (around 450*450) was making my site to flicker (at least on the sections that use that rule) so i edited to use only a css background and part of the problem was solved (Even though I have no idea why).
But the main reason was the .swf object embedding code. (I tried before with out it, but since the .stripped_box was giving me a flicker too i didn't noticed the difference). I tried embedding it using the adobe Dreamweaver swf object code and the traditional embedding system, both of them seems to work ok on chrome and IE8, but not on FFX, so i added the swfobject.js and the problem was solved. Thanks for the ajax suggestions, i was about to go on that direction but i wanted to check one last time. I hope that this question could help somebody with the same issue.
P.S:This issue is still present on IE 9, but i think is not worth to convert my site to ajax just for this version of Msie since it works ok on the IE 8.
<strong>Edit#2:</strong> Even though using the swfObject fixed the issue on firefox, i noticed i could see once in a while the flickering on chrome, not always but still there, so to fix this, i detect the users browser and serve the swf object script if they are using ff, else do nothing, and everything is perfect. I'll have to admit that even though there is no more flickering on ff there is some sort of delay  when switching pages, but that was the best i could do, i hope this helps somebody, cuz i've seen this issue on tons of sites that use flash animations.</p>

"Multiple OAuth Exceptions C# + Cookies + Non-Canvas","<p>Okay, so this is a bit similar to someone else's unanswered question on the codeplex site, but perhaps it'll have more luck here. The first is very much repeatable on even the sample site (CSMvcWebsite):</p>

<p>[FacebookOAuthException: (OAuthException) Error validating access token.]</p>

<p>FacebookApp.Session is NOT null but a call to FacebookApp.Get() throws this booger.</p>

<p>Occurs whenever you're on a page that has called FB JS api's (thus creating an FB session cookie) and then you log out of facebook. If you then reload that page, the above error occurs. Easy to reproduce. Open the sample site and facebook in separate tabs. Click About in the sample. Log out of facebook. Refresh the about page (or click about again).</p>

<p>In the sample site, you can get this to go away pretty easily by navigating to a page that doesn't call FB api's. However, if you have a main page that is a login page (i.e., you can't do squat unless you're logged in), and the login page calls FB api's, then poof! Problem. No other page to navigate to. The only fix is to create and navigate to a bogus page (or manually delete the cookie).</p>

<p>Two problems here. First, how to detect that you're logged out? Perhaps catch the above exception? Is this the only reason you'd get it? Second, how to force the cookie to go away (presumably using JS)???</p>

<p>The second exception has only occurred a couple of times, but again it is one that I've seen unanswered on the codeplex site:</p>

<p>[!sessionValue.Contains("","") Session value must not contain a comma.]</p>

<p>WTH?? Not easy to reproduce (in fact I can't do it on demand at all), but I saw it on an unmodified version of the same sample as above. But this one was even more insidious, as the only solution was to manually delete the cookies (interestingly and perhaps notably there were TWO fbs_ cookies in this case).</p>

<p>Any thoughts or advice??</p>

"How can a Facebook application send a message to all of a user's friends?","<p>We're trying to construct an application that can - at the request of logged-in users with the appropriate blessings within the app - send out a message to any or all of the user's FB friends declaring that they have been sent a gift.</p>

<p>We have been able to get this to work for sending just a small few friends this message, as a wall post (notifications and messages are unavailable in the API). However, with any number of friends larger than ~15, the majority of the users return an <code>OAuthException: (#200) The user hasn't authorized the application to perform this action</code>.</p>

<p>These same users <em>can</em> be sent the message individually or in a small group. However, we expect to have this feature used by users with hundreds or even thousands of friends.</p>

<p>The API docs have not been forthcoming, especially since they are stuck halfway between the old and new Graph interfaces. We are currently using the following code (in precis) to make the API requests, in PHP, in the presence of a current Facebook session with the credentials of our user:</p>

<pre><code>$wall_info = $customer-&gt;getCustomWallData();

$attachment = array(
    'message' =&gt; $wall_info['msg'],
    'name' =&gt; $wall_info['link_title'],
    'caption' =&gt; $wall_info['link_caption'],
    'link' =&gt; $CUZ-&gt;index,
    'description' =&gt; '',
    'picture' =&gt; $CUZ-&gt;http . '/uploads/promo_logo/' . $wall_info['filename'],
    'actions' =&gt; array(
        array('name' =&gt; 'Get Search', 'link' =&gt; 'http://www.google.com')
    )
);

foreach($friendStack as $friend_data) {
    $friend_fb_id = $friend_data['fb_id'];
    $result = $facebook-&gt;api(""/$friend_fb_id/feed/"",'post',$attachment);
}

when a image filter is added a download link will appear at the bottom, when clicked on that link, source of that edited image is created and added to the ""href"" attribute of the download link, and image is downloaded. now I want instead of downloading the image, I want to post that image to the users wall with some caption.</p>

<p>i searched few tutorials but they were showing uploading a pic via HTML form, where user selects image from their hard drive and post it, but here I have source of that image, in javascript variable. as you can see on my app in script.js file the following code at the end of script.js</p>

<pre><code>function showDownload(canvas){


    downloadImage.off('click').click(function(){

        // When the download link is clicked, get the

"How to pass Facebook Id from client to server securely","<p>I have a Facebook canvas app. I am using the JS SDK to authenticate the user on the browser-side and request various information via FB.api (e.g. name, friends, etc.).</p>

<p>I also want to persist some additional user information (not held on Facebook) to the database on my server by making an ajax call:</p>

<pre><code>{ userFavouriteColour: ""Red"" }
</code></pre>

<p>To save this on the server and associate with the correct user, I need to know the Facebook uid and this presents a problem. How do I pass the uid from the client to the server.</p>

<p><strong>Option 1: Add uid to the ajax request</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>{ uid: ""1234567890"",
  userFavouriteColour: ""Red"" }
</code></pre>

<p>This is obviously no good. It would be trivial for anyone to make an ajax request to my web service using someone else's Facebook Id and change their favourite colour.</p>

<p><strong>Option 2: On the server, extract the uid from a cookie</strong>:
Is this even possible? I have read that Facebook sets a cookie containing the uid and access token but do I have access to this cookie on my domain? More importantly, can I <em>securely</em> extract the uid form the cookie or is this open to spoofing just like option 1.</p>

<p><strong>Option 3: User server-side authentication on the server</strong>:
I could use the server-side authentication to validate the user identity on my server. But will this work if I am already using client-side authentication on the browser? Will I end up with two different access tokens? I would like to make FB.api requests from the browser so I need the access token on the client (not just on the server).</p>

<p>This must be a very common scenario so I think I'm missing something fundamental. I have read a lot of the Facebook documentation (various authentication flows, access tokens, signed_request, etc.) and many posts on SO, but I still don't understand how client-side authentication and server-side authentication play nicely together.</p>

<p><strong>In short, I want to know the user's identity on the server but still make requests to the Facebook api from the client browser?</strong></p>

<p>(I am using ASP.NET and the Facebook C# SDK on the server)</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: Added bounty. I was hoping to get a more deifnitive, official recommendation on how to handle this situation, or even an example. As said, I have already read a lot of the official FB docs on authentication flows but I still can't find anything definitive on how client-side and server-side authentication work together.</p>

"Scanning website for vulnerablities","<p>I have found that the local school's website installed a Perl Calendar - this was years ago, it has not been used for ages, but Google has it indexed (which is how I found it) and it full of Viagra links and the like ... program was by Matt Kruse, here is details of the exploit: <a href=""http://www.securiteam.com/exploits/5IP040A1QI.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.securiteam.com/exploits/5IP040A1QI.html</a></p>

<p>I've got the school to remove that, but I think they also have MySQL installed and I'm aware that out-of-the-box there have been some exploits of Admin Tools / Login in old versions. For all I know they also have PHPBB and the like installed ...</p>

<p>The school is just using some cheap, shared hosting; the HTTP response header I get is:</p>

<p>Apache/1.3.29 (Unix) (Red-Hat/Linux) Chili!Soft-ASP/3.6.2 mod_ssl/2.8.14 OpenSSL/0.9.6b PHP/4.4.9 FrontPage/5.0.2.2510</p>

<p>I'm looking for some means of checking if they have other junk installed (quite possibly from way back, and now unused) that might put the site at risk. I'm more interested in something that can scan for things like the MySQL Admin exploit rather than open ports etc. My guess is that they have little control over the hosting space that they have - but I'm a Windows DEV, so this *nix stuff is all Greek to me.</p>

<p>My domain has many subdomains, but only the subdomains that can be accessed with an specific user were hacked, the rest weren't affected. </p>

<p>I assumed that someone entered through SSH, because some of these subdomains are empty and Google doesn't know about them. <strong>But</strong> I checked the access log using the <strong>last</strong> command, but this didn't show any activity through SSH or FTP the day of the attack, neither seven days before.</p>

<p>I already changed my passwords. What do you recommend me to do?</p>

<h2>UPDATE</h2>

<p>My website is hosted at <strong>Dreamhost</strong>. I suppose they have the latest patches installed. But, while I was looking how they entered to my server, <strong>I found weird things.</strong> In one of my subdomains, there were many <strong>scripts for execute commands on the server, upload files, send mass emails and display compromising information.</strong> These files had been <strong>created since last December!!</strong></p>

<p>I have deleted those files and I'm looking for more malicious files.</p>

<p>Maybe the security hold is an old and forgotten PHP application. This application has a file upload form protected by a password system based on sessions.

<p>However I've recently started a new project in ASP.Net MVC and I really have no idea what security holes I'm leaving open. This reason alone is almost putting me off going forth with this.

<p>How do folks approach the problem of integration testing browser-based Facebook integration?

<p>Some specific issues to address:</p>

<p>How does one simulate clicking the <code>&lt;fb:login-button&gt;</code> element? The best thing I've come up with (but have yet to test) is to manually fire a click event on the element. </p>

<p>Once the Facebook dialog comes up, does Capybara have access to it? How? This seems required in order to enter the email address and password of a test Facebook account and to install the Facebook app for the test account.</p>

<p>For that matter, how does one manage test accounts? <a href=""http://developers.facebook.com/docs/test_users/"">http://developers.facebook.com/docs/test_users/</a> indicates that test users can be created and deleted with the Graph API, but the API doesn't look to to provide access to an email address or password for a test account, which seems to make them useless for testing this particular flow.</p>

<p>The application shall be started when an user login, and it will manage the user session (manage applications, windows...). Only one user can be managed at time.</p>

<p>What I'm asking is which is the best solution for requesting privilege acquisition, since the application requires it (execute a process which calls SetWindowsHook).</p>

<ul>
<li>How it possible to run any process at user login with (higher) privileges, possibly without prompting UAC messages? The setup operations could be peformed during the installation phase...</li>
<li>How could be possible to run an utility service starting a process when user logon? In this way the (installed) service could run the effective process with any priviledges...</li>

"Pass username/password from Windows Forms application to an ASP.NET web application","<p>Here is the situation:</p>

<ul>
<li>C# Windows Forms application</li>
<li>ASP.NET web application</li>
<li>Both authenticate with a custom user table in the same database (usename/password) and create a User object that is used throughout both applications</li>
</ul>

<p>A user is logged into the Windows Forms application and we want to launch a URL to open a page in the ASP.NET web application in the default browser (IE, Chrome, Firefox, etc.).  We want to pass the current username/password from the Windows Forms application to the ASP.NET web application in order to keep the user from having to log into the web application separately.</p>

<p>Based on our research, here are some options we have found (and the drawbacks):</p>

<ul>
<li>Pass username/password in URL as QueryStrings and create the User object in the web application
<ul>
<li>Not secure (password visible in URL)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Create a temporary HTML page on the client machine that includes a JavaScript OnLoad function that POSTs username/password to the target URL and create the User object in the web application
<ul>
<li>(Could not find a way to POST data directly to a URL and display URL in default browser using C#)</li>
<li>Not secure (password visible in temporary page)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Create a ""Handoff"" table to store username/password with a key that gets passed to the page via QueryString and deleted from the table when the page loads and create the User object in the web application
<ul>
<li>Small potential for key to be intercepted (hackers)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Have a separate MongoDB that stores the User object and retrieve it in the web application
<ul>
<li>Separate software (MongoDB) running - additional point of failure</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>All of this is so that the user doesn't have to type their username/password twice to log into both applications.</p>

<p>Which one of the above options above would work best (most secure, least overhead/maintenance)?</p>

<p><strong>OR</strong></p>

<p>Is there a way to create a Forms Authentication ticket (cookie?) in the C# application that could be used by the default browser?</p>

<p><strong>OR</strong></p>

<p>Is there a better, secure method for handling this?</p>

<p>(edit)</p>

<p><strong>OR</strong></p>

<p>Is there a good argument for requiring the user to enter the username/password again to access the web application if they're already authenticated from the Windows Forms application?  If so, can you provide links to references?  Best practices, web security standards, etc.</p>

"Looking for a host based network monitor solution","<p><strong>Hi all!</strong></p>

<h2>Problem</h2>

<p>So, my hosting company has a network usage graph for my dedicated server. It seems that one day earlier this month, my network usage suddenly spiked with several hundred megabytes transferred (usually it's in the tens, not hundreds). It was probably me, but i just can't be sure who or what it was.</p>

<h2>Question</h2>

<p>So my question is; does anyone know of any host based solution for monitoring network usage that would tell me the client's IP-address, the port/service he/she used?</p>

<p><em>What I don't want</em></p>

<p>I'm just guessing that someone will suggest i use nagios, munin, zabbix, cacti, mrtg - I've also looked at those, but a graph over network usage will not give me the answers I'm looking for. :-)</p>

<p><em>Almost there</em></p>

<p>I've already looked at a lot of monitoring solutions, and I've tried [ntop][http://www.ntop.org/], [darkstat][http://unix4lyfe.org/darkstat/] and others. Darkstat just didn't give me the answers. Although it listed a lot of statistics, and i could list the clients - it doesn't show me the network usage for a particular period. Ntop is by far the best I've seen so far - but i think it mostly shows current network usage, not the historical part. I could run <code>apt-get upgrade</code> and download a whole bunch of software, but not see it in the log afterwards.</p>

"What makes you trust that a piece of open source software is not malicious?","<p>We developers are in a unique position when it comes to the ability to not only be skeptical about the capabilities provided by open source software, but to actively analyze the code since it is freely available.  In fact, one may even argue that open source software developers have a social <em>responsibility</em> to do so to contribute to the community.</p>

<p>But <em>at what point do you as a developer say, ""I better take a look at what this is doing before I trust using it"" for any given thing</em>?  Is it a matter of trusting code with your personal information?  Does it depend on the source you're getting it from?</p>

<p>What spurred this question on was <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1347765"" rel=""nofollow"">a post on Hacker News</a> to a javascript bookmarklet that supposedly tells you how ""exposed"" your information on Facebook is as well as recommending some fixes.  I thought for a second ""I'd rather not start blindly running this code over all my (fairly locked down) Facebook information so let me check it out"".</p>

<p>The bookmarklet is simple enough, but it calls another javascript function which at the time (but not anymore) was highly compressed and undecipherable - though understandbly more for optimization than obfuscation.  That's when I said ""nope, not gonna do it"".  So even though I could have verified the original uncompressed javascript from the <a href=""http://github.com/mjpizz/reclaimprivacy"" rel=""nofollow"">Github site</a> and even saved a local copy to verify and then run without hitting their server, I wasn't going to.  It's several thousand lines and I'm not a total javascript guru to begin with.</p>

<p>Yet, folks are using it anyway.  Even (supposedly) bright developers.  What makes them trust the script?  Did they all scrutinize it line by line?  Do they know the guy personally and trust him not to do anything bad?  Do they just take his word?</p>

<p><strong>What makes you trust that a piece of open source software is not malicious?</strong></p>

<p>Note, to clarify, the reason I limit the scope of the discussion to open source software is because with open source software it can often be a matter of ""do I want to expend the effort to do a proper analysis or should I just go ahead?""  When the opportunity to check is there, when do you skip it and just implicitly trust the software? </p>

<p>My problem, is that when I run this code on a simple sample file with 3 or so hyperlinks in it across a single page, it returns everything exactly how I want, with the file path/name at the top and all the links in the page directly below it (address in one column, displayed text in the other).  However, when I run it on one of the files I am writing this code for (a 95+ page .docx file with ~30 links), it prints out the path/file in the formatted section, and then drops 90 (90 every time) blank lines before printing out the path/file a second time, and then all the links in the document.  It does it perfectly, except for the inexplicable second path/file (even there if I comment out the bit I put in) and the 90 blank entries.</p>

<p>Can anyone explain what's going on, or should I try to figure out a way to just bypass the issue by removing my own link code, and including a bit that removes all blank lines?</p>

"How can I add and view other AD LDAP attributes in a WAS v8.0 federated repository's LDAP repository?","<p>Within WebSphere Application Server v8.0.0.5, I've set up a Security Domain.  Within that Security Domain, I've created a federated repository consisting of:</p>

I can't figure out how to create AND THEN view/confirm a new LDAP repo property named ""title"" and map it to an existing LDAP attribute also named ""title"".

<p>Once I restart WAS, navigate to my domain, and click on ""Manage users"", I don't see the ""title"" property listed.  I only see User ID, First Name, Last Name, E-mail, and Unique Name columns listed.  How can I view the ""title"" property?</p>

"LinqToExcel: How do I exclude certain rows?","<p>I've been struggling with this for a few days now and I'm stumped.  I'm hoping that someone can provide an alternate suggestion.
Basically, I'm reading data from excel using LinqToExcel.  But I want to exclude all rows with a ""Rating"" of ""NR"".  Here's a sample of my data:</p>

<pre><code>CompanyName Rating  SalesMan
Apple       2       Steve
Google      NR      Steve
Microsoft   3       John
Dell        1       Steve
Pepsi       3       John

<p>I just want to find all companies that belong to Steve but doesn't have a rating of ""NR"".  My final list should be:</p>

<pre><code>CompanyName SalesMan
Apple       Steve
Dell        Steve
</code></pre>

<p>I've tried the following code but it doesn't work:</p>

<p>1)</p>

<pre><code>var masterList = masterDataXL.Worksheet(""data_all"").Where(d =&gt; !d[""Rating""].Equals(""NR""));
</code></pre>

<p>2)</p>

<pre><code>var masterList = masterDataXL.Worksheet(""data_all"")

        m[""SalesMan""].ToString().Contains(resAnLastName)) // check for last name
    .Select(m =&gt; new ResAnTicksDataClass
    {
        Company = m[""CompanyName""],
        Rating = m[""Rating""],
        Seller = m[""SalesMan""]
    }).AsEnumerable();
</code></pre>

"What is the best way to send web form authentication data over HTTP?","<p>A company I know is in discussions to firm up its password security policy across all its web application products.</p>

<p>Right now they are sending username / password authentication in POST forms over HTTP, and thus, they are being sent plaintext.</p>

<p>The simplest solution to the problem is simply to require HTTPS for logon across all our applications, right?</p>

<p>Well, there's some internal discussion about instead doing some kind of roll-our-own client-side encryption of passwords (password + salt, etc.).  </p>

<p>Is there an accepted HTTP-only solution?</p>

<p>Opinions are like... well, everyone has an opinion, so I'm looking for credible security literature that can support your recommendation.  Don't just google and send me to a blog post... I've already done that and further.</p>

<p>I have found OWASP's recommendations:
<a href=""http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2007-A7#Protection"">http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2007-A7#Protection</a></p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Giving your recommendation for using SSL isn't enough.  I need some kind of supporting documentation.  I KNOW that rolling our own client side encryption is bad.  I need to be able to credibly sell that to co-workers and management.  </p>

<p>Also, HTTP Digest has been mentioned.  Seems nice, but Digest is ONLY for HTTP authentication, and not for data sent over POST.</p>

"How to prevent javascript print from blocking other scripts","<p>I am writing a firefox application, where I substitute content of a  element for printing, i.e. when you click browser the following is done:
1)printable version is generated
2)browser navigates to this printable version
3)browser content is printed
4)browser navigates back to original page</p>

<p>The problem is that the original page has some important javascript handling while it is loaded, but printing operation (and it may take quite a while) blocks javascript.
As a result, what happens is that when page is loaded printing is in process, so page's javascript is blocked => page is not complete.</p>

<p>Is there any way to prevent print method from blocking javascript?
Or any way to catch event printComplete or something - so that I could trigger navigation when javascript is no longer blocked?
Maybe there are some other workarounds...?</p>

<p>How do I set the background colour of each cell if the length of the string in it is greater than say 5? ('Canada' cell would be highlighted in my example)</p>

<p>I know you can do conditional formatting with something using something like <code>LEN(A1)&gt;5</code> but I want this rule to be implemented on the entire column.</p>

<p>I've tried copying the rule over (or maybe I'm copying it over wrong), but then <code>A1</code> stays as <code>A1</code> even when the cell if <code>A2</code>.</p>

<p>After I successfully got a hello world in Google App Engine, I followed all the instructions from the Facebook Example. However, when going to localhost port 8080 (Getting Started, step 8) I'm prompted with the annoying ""Please Update Your Secure Canvas URL"" error; pressing Continue doesn't do anything but to prompt me again to update my URL.</p>

<p>I read that the dev_appserver.py doesn't have SSL support, so I guess that's why when I put localhost port 8080 with SSL in my Secure Canvas URL, I get a ssl_error_rx_record_too_long error. So that's a dead end.</p>

<p>Now, I read that maybe my personal security settings as an admin of the app was messing things up. So, I tried with a test user; using localhost with SSL as a Secure Canvas URL pops the same error than before, but leaving it in blank gets me to the running with friends homepage; just before I was going to claim victory, I noticed that the refresh icon was going crazy, so by opening firebug I saw that the site was going GET requests like crazy; I opened the headers of the queries and got this:</p>

<pre><code>Reload the page to get source for: https://apps.facebook.com/facebook-skuiz/
</code></pre>

<p>as long with other GET request that does other GET request that... well, you get the drill.</p>

# Facebook Application ID and Secret.
FACEBOOK_APP_ID = 'XXX'

# Facebook User IDs of admins. The poor mans admin system.

"XUL button looks like disabled and is not ""pushable"" (but onclick function is invoked)","<p>I'm developing a Firefox extension. I'm familiar with JS, CSS, XML but new to XUL.</p>

<p>I want to override Downloads in the way that adds a button next to each downloaded file to rename it. I've already done it (placing a button and handling rename logic).</p>

<p>The thing that left is UI. The button looks like disabled, but apparently is not, because I can click it and the popup appears.</p>

<p>Here it is how it looks now:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/LWXMe.png"" alt=""XUL button in Firefox downloads""></p>

<p>and the corresponding code:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;xul:button label=""Rename"" tabindex=""1"" onclick=""foo()""/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Adding <code>disabled=""false""</code> doesn't help. I can add <code>style=""color:black; text-shadow:0 0;""</code> and <em>this makes it look like intended</em>, but there are several problems (and I guess disabled-like look might be the cause):</p>

<ul>
<li>The button I added is not ""pushable"" in the manner like the native ""Clear list"" button (pushing it doesn't change its look, i.e. it doesn't ""go down""). However, <code>foo()</code> is invoked.</li>
<li>I can't navigate to the button with <kbd>Tab</kbd> from keyboard.</li>
<li>I've read one should prefer <code>command</code> / <code>oncommand</code> instead of <code>onclick</code> (because of <kbd>Tab</kbd> navigation for instance), but in my example, only <code>onclick</code> invokes <code>foo()</code>. The two other don't work.</li>
</ul>

<p>In case more detailed code is needed (I borrowed it entirely from some other extension):</p>

<pre class=""lang-xml prettyprint-override""><code> &lt;binding id=""download-done"" extends=""chrome://mozapps/content/downloads/download.xml#download-base""&gt;

<p>For the things to be even more weird, I've taken, from the same file, two another bindings ( <code>&lt;binding id=""download-paused""&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;binding id=""download-downloading""&gt;</code>) and added exactly the same <code>&lt;xul:button&gt;</code> to them, and in both cases, the button is both ""pushable"" and black (in short, normal, as it should be). It is also navigable from keyboard with <kbd>Tab</kbd>, even without setting <code>tabindex</code> explicitly.</p>

"I need advice developing a sensitive data transfer/storage/encryption system","<p>I got closed on SO and told to post this here as it's about general application design as opposed to specific code.</p>

<h2>Intro</h2>

<p>I'm currently working on a project which involves the daily extraction of data (pharmacy records) from a VisualFox Pro database, and uploading some of it to a WordPress site, where clients of the pharmacy can securely view it. I would like some advice in terms of the general methodology of my software - I am able to code it, but need to know if I'm going the right way about it. I'm writing both the PC software (in C#/.NET 4.5) and the PHP WordPress plugin. (It doesn't matter much that it's in WordPress, the actual code for this will pretty much run separately).</p>

<h2>Question 1: Encryption</h2>

<p>The current process for encrypting the data server-side I plan to use is based on <a href=""http://i.amniels.com/mysql-database-encryption-using-public-private-keys"" rel=""nofollow"">this article</a>. Summarised, it advocates encrypting each separate user's data asymmetrically with their own public key, stored on the server. The private key to decrypt this data is then itself encrypted symmetrically using the user's password, and stored. This way, even if the database is stolen, the user's password hash needs to be broken, and even then the process needs to be repeated for every user's data.</p>

<p>The only weakness, pointed out by the author himself, and the main point of my question, is the fact that while the user is logged in, the decrypted key is stored in session storage. The way the article suggests to deal with it is to just limit the time the user is logged in. I thought a better solution would be to store that key in a short-lived secure cookie (of course the whole process is happening over HTTPS). That way, if the attacker has control of the user's computer and can read their cookies, they can probably just keylog their password and log in, no need to steal the database, while even if the attacker gains access to the server, they cannot decrypt the HTTPS traffic (or can they? I'm not sure.)</p>

<p><strong>Should I use secure cookies or session storage to temporarily store the decrypted key?</strong></p>

<h2>Question 2: Storage</h2>

<p>The second thing I still want to work out is how to store the data - this is more of an efficiency problem. Since every user has their own key for encryption, it follows that records for every user must be stored separately. I don't know if I should store a ""block"" of data for every user, containing encrypted JSON with an array of objects representing records, or whether I should store records in a table with the actual data structure, and encrypt each data field separately with the key.</p>

<p>I am leaning towards storing the data as one block - it seems to me to be more efficient to decrypt one big block of data at a time, than perhaps several thousands separate fields. Also, even if I stored the data in its proper structure, I still wouldn't be able to use MySQL's WHERE, ORDERBY etc, since the data would all be BLOBs.</p>

<p><strong>Should I store the data as a big block per user, or separated into the different fields?</strong></p>

<h2>Question 3: Transfer</h2>

<p>I extract the data from the DBF file, and essentially make a ""diff"", whereby I compare the current extracted data from the last day's data, and only upload the blocks of the users that have changed (I can't only upload the records, as I probably will end up storing the users' data in blocks). I also include ""delete"" instructions for users which have been deleted. This is as there are hundreds of thousands records in the database, totalling over 200mb, and the size increases every day.</p>

<p>My current plan is to write all this data to a JSON file, gzip it and upload it to the server. My question is, how do I do that while ensuring the security of the data? Naturally, the upload will happen over HTTPS, and I have an API password in place to only allow authorised uploads, but my main concern is how to protect the data if the server is compromised. I don't want the attacker to just grab the JSON file from the server while it's being processed. One idea I had was to get the server to send me a list of public keys for the users, and perform the encryption in my software, before the upload. It seems to me like that's the only way of protecting that data. I could encrypt the whole JSON file, perhaps with an API key or a special password, but that's moot if the attacker can just access the decrypted file as it's being processed on the server. Is that a good solution?</p>

<p><strong>Should I encrypt the data individually client-side, or is there a way to securely transfer it to the server and encrypt it there?</strong></p>

<p>Thanks in advance for any answers, I'd love to hear from someone who's dealt with problems like this before.</p>

<p>Matt</p>

<p><strong>EDIT: I'm pretty decided on 1 and 2 - thanks @Morons. I'll use secure cookies and store data in blocks. My main question is now question 3, would love to get some input on that.</strong></p>

"PHP Security and XSS attacks - Getting Error Refused to execute a JavaScript script. Source code of script found within request","<p>I'm going through my site and doing a security audit. I've simply accepted the fact that I need to sanitize ALL user input, but I've never really stopped and experimented with what's really going on. I'm starting to experiment now.</p>

<p>I have a typical contact form on a PHP page. It's <code>_POST</code>ing data. <code>$_POST[""first_name""];</code> etc.</p>

<p>I do this <code>$firstName = htmlspecialchars($_POST[""first_name""]);</code> to sanitize and display a message like the one below.</p>

<pre><code>echo $firstName . ', thank you for your interest. We'll be in touch soon!'
</code></pre>

<p>I started to play with this and if I enter something such as <code>&lt;script&gt;alert('hello')&lt;/script&gt;</code> in the first name field, <code>htmlspecialchars</code> does it's job and coverts the tags. </p>

<p>When I remove <code>htmlspecialchars</code> the script doesn't get converted and it displays in the source as <code>&lt;script&gt;alert('hello')&lt;/script&gt;</code> BUT, it does not execute.</p>

<p>My question is, why doesn't this execute? Isn't this basically what an XSS attack would do? Am I misunderstanding something?</p>

"Configuring Firefox 3.0.x to send a Kerberos token","<p>I'm trying to convince Firefox 3.0.14 to send a Kerberos token.  I have configured the service correctly and IE will send a Kerberos token (i.e. starting YI..), but after adding the hostname to the network.negotiate-auth.trusted-uris and network.negotiate-auth.delegation-uris settings in about:config, Firefox only sends an NTLM token.  Here's the (cut down) output from Live Headers:</p>

<p>to server -></p>

<pre><code>GET /testsso.jsp HTTP/1.1

<p>The server is only interested in a Kerberos token, i.e. one starting in YI, so issues the Unauthorized on the second request, at which point Firefox gives up.</p>

<p>When I reloaded the page in my editor, the js login box showed up and I need to authorize the app again, so it seemed to have worked fine. But then when I tried to publish or update a FB page, it kept getting these errors. </p>

<pre><code>code 300    
message ""(#300) Edit failure""

<p>The funny thing is that the page does get published and the updates are also published on fB itself. So the publishing and updating of the page works fine, but it also produces this error which messes up my script.</p>

<pre><code>FB.api('/'+pageTabId+'?access_token='+pageAccessToken, 'post', params, function(response) {
    if (!response || response.error) { //
        console.log(""Error Installing:"");

<p>I tried to logout of FB, uninstall the app, remove all cookies and cache. But none of it seems to make a difference.. I had this before, but then it suddenly disappeared. But that doesn't seem to be the case this time.</p>

<p>I have created my own ""Facebook App"" called ""Nicks Poster App"" via my own personal facebook account.   I have granted three permissions (offline_access,read_stream,publish_stream) to the app for both my personal page and my company page.
i did this by following these steps for each account...</p>

<pre><code>Creating the app...
1.       Login to facebook with the account you want linked to the app
2.       Follow this link http://www.facebook.com/developers/apps.php#!/developers/createapp.php
3.       Create your app and take a note of you App Id and your App secret Id.

Giving the correct rights to the app and getting the access_token..
Method 1:
1.       Get the account in question to login to facebook
2.       However you like, direct the user to this link (replacing &lt;App-Id&gt; with the App Id of the created app) https://graph.facebook.com/oauth/authorize?client_id=&lt;App-Id&gt;&amp;scope=offline_access,read_stream&amp;redirect_uri=http://www.facebook.com/connect/login_success.html
3.       Take a note of the result of the “code” querystring.
4.       Goto this url (replace “&lt;APP-ID&gt;” with you appId and “&lt;APP-SECRET&gt;” with your apps secret id and “&lt;code&gt;” with the copied code)
https://graph.facebook.com/oauth/access_token?client_id=&lt;APP-ID&gt;&amp;redirect_uri=http://www.facebook.com/connect/login_success.html&amp;client_secret=&lt;APP-SECRET&gt;&amp;code=&lt;code&gt;
5.       Copy what you see, minus the expires querystring.  That is your access_token.

<p>What the problem? Well... when for example I send an invitation (and write to some friend wall) on his wall it's written that this message is from him, not from me. When I select more than one friend to send invitation, it's get the first selected and use him's name. </p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

"Advice on IIS log analysis, for finding footprints of hackers","<p>I need to find out how a website was hacked, I have the relevant IIS logs, but since there are too many visitors, It would be nice to have some kind of log analyzer that was not designed to only give you info about traffic but also would let you filter the useless lines of logs and even possibly highlight the suspicious ones. </p>

<p>Do you know any such tool?</p>

<p>Also the website was probably hacked through sql injection, any advice on what too search for? I know I should be looking for weird parameters, but that's not enough because the hacker might have used some forms to POST data, which are not logged in the log files all the time.</p>

"Creating a secure, web-based password management system with the ability to share data between users","<p>I apologize in advance for the incoming <strong>Wall-O-Text</strong>. This is (at least, to me) a fairly complex issue that I've put quite a bit of thought into. You can read my question and also see a <strong>test implementation</strong> in Ruby (very hastily built, not database-backed, and probably very ugly) at <a href=""https://gist.github.com/888975/cbccec57b74ad8d6bad14b41f70d3c784c33811a"" rel=""nofollow"">this GitHub Gist</a> if you are so inclined.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Imagine one was required to create a web-based password management system
(over SSL! :) with the following requirements:</p>

<ol>
<li>Individual users sign in to the system using their own unique pass
 phrase.</li>
<li>This pass phrase should be enough to allow the user to use the system
 effectively (e.g. from a smartphone, etc.)--the point being that they
 should not have to keep a key file with them.</li>
<li>Users can store arbitrary-length bits of data in the system (""entries"").</li>
<li>Entries are encrypted in the database in such a way that there is not
 enough information in the database or application alone to read the
 encrypted entries.</li>
<li>Users should be able to ""share"" entries with other users of the system
 so that the other user(s) can read the contents of the entry.</li>
</ol>

<p>I'm no expert in cryptography. After thinking about it for a while, I came up
with the following.  <strong>My question</strong> is: is this implementation secure? Am I
missing something? If so, is the above spec even implementable? Or is this
overkill?</p>

<h2>Database</h2>

<p>The database is set up as such:</p>

<pre><code>+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|  users                                                                       |
+---------+--------------+--------------+---------------+----------------------+
| salt    | pub_key      | enc_priv_key | priv_key_hmac |                      |
+---------+--------------+--------------+---------------+----------------------+
|  entries                                                                     |
+---------+--------------+--------------+---------------+----------+-----------+
| user_id | parent_entry | enc_sym_key  | sym_key_sig   | enc_data | data_hmac |
+---------+--------------+--------------+---------------+----------+-----------+
</code></pre>

<h2>Basic Use Cases</h2>

<p>Let's imagine two users of the system, Alice and Bob.</p>

<p>Bob <strong>signs up for the site</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Bob enters a password. This password is sent to the server (but not
stored).</li>
<li>The server generates a random salt and stores it in the <code>salt</code> field.</li>
<li>The server generates the SHA-256 hash of Bob's password and salt.</li>
<li>The server generates an RSA key pair. The public key is stored as plain
text in the <code>pub_key</code> field. The private key is encrypted via AES-256
using the hash generated from Bob's password and salt as the key and
stored in the <code>enc_priv_key</code> field.</li>
<li>The server generates a hash-based message authentication code for Bob's
private key using Bob's password and salt as the key and stores this in
the <code>priv_key_hmac</code> field.</li>
</ul>

<p>Bob <strong>stores an entry in the system</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Bob enters some data to be stored as an entry along with his password.
This data is sent to the server.</li>
<li>The server generates a key to be used as a key for AES-256 encryption.</li>
<li>The server uses this key to encrypt the data and stores the result in
the <code>enc_data</code> field.</li>
<li>The server generates a hash-based message authentication code for the
data using the generated key and stores this in the <code>data_hmac</code> field.</li>
<li>The symmetric key used to encrypt the data is encrypted with Bob's public
key and stored in the <code>enc_sym_key</code> field.</li>
<li>The server uses Bob's private key to generate a signature for the
symmetric key.</li>
</ul>

<p>Bob <strong>retrieves his stored entry</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Bob enters his password and the ID of the entry to retrieve.</li>
<li>The server generates the SHA-256 hash of Bob's password and salt.</li>
<li>Bob's encrypted private key is decrypted via AES-256 encryption using the
hash.</li>
<li>The server verifies that Bob's encrypted private key has not been
tampered with by checking the HMAC in <code>priv_key_hmac</code>.</li>
<li>The server decrypts the symmetric key stored in the <code>enc_sym_key</code> field
using Bob's private key.</li>
<li>The server verifies that the encrypted symmetric key has not been tampered
with by verifying the signature in <code>sym_key_sign</code> using Bob's public key.</li>
<li>The server decrypts the data using the symmetric key.</li>
<li>The server verifies that the encrypted data has not been tampered with
by verifying the HMAC stored in the <code>data_hmac</code> field.</li>
<li>The server returns the decrypted data to Bob.</li>
</ul>

<p>Bob <strong>shares an entry with Alice</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Bob wants Alice to have access to an entry he owns. He enters his
password and the ID of the entry to share.</li>
<li>The data for the entry is decrypted using the method in ""Bob retrieves
his stored entry.""</li>
<li>A new entry is created for Alice in the same fashion as in ""Bob stores
an entry in the system,"" with the following exceptions:
<ol>
<li>The entry's <code>parent_entry</code> is set to Bob's entry.</li>
<li>The signature for the symmetric key is calculated using Bob's private
 key (since Alice's private key is not available to Bob).</li>
<li>When Alice accesses this new entry, the existence of a non-null
 <code>parent_entry</code> causes the system to use Bob's public key to verify
 the signature (since his private key was used to create it).</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>

<p>Bob <strong>changes the data in his shared entry</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Bob decides to change the data in the entry he shared with Alice. Bob
indicates the entry ID to modify and the new data it should contain.</li>
<li>The system overwrites the data created in ""Bob stores an entry in the
system.""</li>
<li>The system finds every entry with a <code>parent_entry</code> equal to the entry
that was just modified, and for each one overwrites the data created in
""Bob shares an entry with Alice.""</li>
</ul>

<h2>Analysis</h2>

<p>Advantages:</p>

<ul>
<li>It is impossible to decrypt any data from the database without the
password of the user that owns the data, as the private key necessary to
decrypt the data is encrypted with the user's password, and that password
(and it's hash) is not stored in the database.</li>
<li>If a user wants to change their password, only their encrypted private
key needs to be regenerated (decrypt the private key with the old
password/hash, then re-encrypt it with the new password/hash).</li>
<li>Shared entries are stored as actual separate records in the database,
so there is no need to share a key between multiple users/groups of users.</li>
</ul>

<p>Disadvantages/Problems (that I can think of):</p>

<ul>
<li>If a shared entry is modified, the system must re-encrypt every child
entry; with a large number of users sharing data, this could potentially
be computationally expensive.</li>
<li>Shared entries depend on the parent user's public key for signature
verification. If the user is deleted, or their key changes, the signatures
are invalid.</li>
</ul>

<p>Repeated from the introduction: my question is: is this implementation
secure? Am I missing something? If so, is the above spec even implementable?
Or is this overkill?</p>

<p>Thanks for sticking it out this long. I'm interested in your opinions! Am I on the right track, or a complete moron? YOU DECIDE! :)</p>

"Which encryption method would produce this result","<p>I am doing a security review on a system.</p>

<p>From one part of the system to another, information is sent using an encrypted string.</p>

<p>This string is over 400 characters long, but within it are 4 sets of 10 identical characters. I am assuming that the data that was encrypted also has this pattern, for example the word ""parameters"".</p>

<p>I have tested encrypting a string containing several identical strings with DES, but do not get the same pattern.</p>

<p>Question is: Is there an encryption method that would produce this result. Or have the parts been encrypted seperatly and conncatinated?</p>

"Does a router limit a outgoing connection to a particular host?","<p>This is being asked in he context of a router that has no port forwarding enabled.  I.e. no incoming connections accepted. Outgoing only.</p>

<p>I read something on a forum where someone said that whenever you as a client are behind a router, and connect to a particular host, then that opens up a port on your router and forwards ALL inbound traffic attempting to connect to the port, regardless of the source of that traffic, and thus while that connection is open it is just as insecure as if you setup port forwarding for that port.  In other words, some malicious third party, that is coming from some other address besides the host, could connect to that port.</p>

<p>My understanding was that when I initiate an outgoing connection to a host, then the listening port is limited to communication with that host address.  In otherwords, a third party's incoming connection would not be able to access that port.  However, this one lone person seemed to imply that only a firewall did this.  This kind of violates my understanding of how a connections works and how a router maps the listening port for an outgoing connection(I was going to add there's plenty of holes in my knowledge to violate, but then I realized that sounded really bad.).  </p>

<p>Does a router limit an outgoing connection to communicating with the destination host?  Or does the router also forward from other third parties that are not originating from the destination host if they try to connect to that listening port?</p>

"Extended facebook access token","<p>I got a short-lived access token from the signed_request generated by facebook registration plugin inside the java class. After that I call the extended access token code

</code></pre>

<p>in the java class, and it returns a extended access token that valid for 60 days. I stored that in database.</p>

<p>After that until the short_lived_token expired, my ""login with facebook"" works well that means it calls the javascript method i.e fbLogin() that specified in the on-login attribute of ""facebook login plugin"" and regenerate a new short_lived_token.</p>

<p>The code is :</p>

<pre><code>&lt;fb:login-button on-login=""fbLogin();""
registration-url=""my_redirect_url""&gt;Login With Facebook&lt;/fb:login-button&gt;

&lt;script&gt;

<p>What I'm trying to do is to create a macro that automates a function for me. I have to deal with tons of contracts all the time and imputing information (like names, adresses and ID numbers) on each .doc than saving that doc as PDF is really time consuming. So I trying creating an excel table where I can imput that information which automaticaly saves to the .doc, this copy + paste is done with the special paste function (if I change something in the excel it changes the .doc so I have the whole contract typed out with some blank spaces that get filled in as I type in excel).</p>

<p>After filling up the cells in excel with the appropriate information I need to ""save as"" that doc as a PDF with the info from one of the cells (in this case the specific cell is where the company name's typed out), then I need o copy that excel table into a new tab that will have the name of the company (the same cell where the .doc was save as).</p>

"Button to call multiple class anchor click events only calls one then gives unhelping error","<p>I have written a greasemonkey script to customise the way I browse theawesomer.com. I wanted to have a little button I could click next to the post to store the link in a list so I could copy and paste the list into an email and send it to myself for later viewing. I have an email button in another version of the script which automates this fine, I just removed it from this post as it wasn't relevant.</p>

<p>The problem: I have this 'Remove All' button which should, using a jquery class selector, call the click event handler for each of the elements it finds. The click event removes a link in the list and the associated remove link button (not the 'Remove All' button). However it only removes the top item from the list and then throws an error saying 'Component not found' but doesn't point to a line in my code. Can anyone help me find out what is going wrong and how to fix it?</p>

"Console logging from a Firefox add-on","<p>The Mozilla documentation (<a href=""https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/developers/docs/sdk/latest/dev-guide/console.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/developers/docs/sdk/latest/dev-guide/console.html</a>) says that I should use <code>console.log</code> to generate messages from an extension. Those messages are said to appear in the Firefox Error Console. But this is not the case for me. I'm using the Addon builder for the first time today, and I'd like to create an extension that switches tabs on certain events. The tabs are indeed switched, and to a tab which I expected, so my code definitely runs. But the console.log output is nowhere to see.</p>

<p>I have set the filter to ""All"". All I see are CSS warnings from the addon builder itself.</p>

<p>I have also installed Firebug. It doesn't show anything, too. (This works fine when using console.log from the context of a web page though.) The problem with Firebug would be that it's only enabled for one/some tab anyway, so when switching tabs, it's useless. I need a log window that's always there.</p>

<p>So where will the output from console.log end up?</p>

"Writing a PHP plugin system with limited system access","<p>So I'm thinking of building a CMS, sort of, and I'd like it to be designed so that plugins can extend its functionality easily (I'm working on a hook system and language setup as well).</p>

<p>Here's the tricky part: rather than an individually packaged CMS, I'm trying to make a sort of host for many sites (e.g. mycms.com/your-site).</p>

<p>I'm designing the MySQL database with a structure like this:</p>

<pre><code>pages
 - id
 - slug
 - title
 - content
 - site // The site id
sites
 - id
 - path // e.g. your-site
 - password // hash
</code></pre>

<p>Then I'll store plugins like this in the file structure:</p>

<pre><code>plugins/
  42/   // Site id
    hello-world/   // plugin name
      hello-world.php
      functions.php
      css/   // ...
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, there's a critical security problem here. Say a plugin author codes hello-world.php like so:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
 include '../../../core/config.inc.php';
 echo $config['mysql']['password']; // Now they have my server's database password!
?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>How do I circumvent something like this? How can I control it so that hello-world.php only has access to files within the directory hello-world/ and nothing above it? Essentially, I want to ban plugins from accessing files outside of their own directory.</p>

<p>This must be simple, right?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

"Is Windows simple file sharing safe?","<p>Windows (in this case XP) allows me to simply ""share a folder"" via its <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Message_Block"" rel=""nofollow"">SMB protocol</a>, and I can access it via Linux quite nicely (with <a href=""http://www.samba.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">Samba</a>), no questions asked.</p>

<p>That's what bothers me, it just does not feel secure, and the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Message_Block#Security"" rel=""nofollow"">""security"" section</a> of the Wikipedia page is discouraging.
I love being able to just tell Windows to share a folder and imediately have these personal files on the Linux box (and with R/W access), but I don't want these files to be deletable or even accessible from the internet. I'm not even being asked a password! Can people all over the world access my shared folders without a password too?</p>

<p>The topography is: One machine Windows XP SP3, the other Linux Mint Debian edition, and both connected to the internet (and to each other) via a router that my ISP gave me. It has WPA-encrypted Wi-FI, but I connect these two via LAN cable.</p>

"Facebook iOS SDK: authorize with permissions requires 2 attempts","<p>I have an app that still uses the deprecated Facebook class to connect with Facebook.  If I authorize with no extended permissions, everything works fine.  But if I do include permissions, the first round trip to authorize always fails (even though it gets a valid token!).  Am I missing a step?</p>

<p>Here's the code to initiate Facebook authorization for the app</p>

<pre><code>- (IBAction) doConnect:(id)sender
{
    NSArray* permissions = [NSArray arrayWithObjects:
                            @""email"",@""publish_actions"",nil];
    [self.facebook authorize:permissions];
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here's the code that gets invoked after the user has granted permissions and control returns to my app.  The url always includes a nice looking token, even the first time through.</p>

<pre><code>// handle the incoming url from app switching
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application openURL:(NSURL *)url
  sourceApplication:(NSString *)sourceApplication annotation:(id)annotation
{
    return [self.facebook handleOpenURL:url];
}
</code></pre>

<p>And here's the FBSessionDelegate method that gets invoked after a successful connect.  Even though the url above contained a token, it's gone the first time we get here. But if I invoke the doConnect method above, the token will be present when we get here.</p>

<pre><code>// FBSessionDelegate
- (void)fbDidLogin
{
    if( [self.facebook accessToken] == nil )
    {
        NSLog(@""Had an access token above, but not now!"");

        // If I reinvade the doConnect: method again, it will work!!!
    }
    // ...
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>Looking deep in the sdk code in FBSession.m, it seems that the requested permissions haven't been associated with the new token first time through, causing the session to ignore the new token.  First time through, cachedPermissions is always an empty list</p>

<pre><code>    // get the cached permissions, and do a subset check
    NSArray *cachedPermissions = [tokenInfo objectForKey:FBTokenInformationPermissionsKey];
    BOOL isSubset = [FBSession areRequiredPermissions:permissions

"a safer no password sudo?","<p>Ok, here's my problem - Please don't yell at me for being insecure! :) This is on my host machine. I'm the only one using it so it's fairly safe, but I have a very complex password that is hard to type over and over. I use the console for moving files around and executing arbitrary commands a LOT, and I switch terminals, so sudo remembering for the console isn't enough (AND I still have to type in my terrible password at least once!) In the past I have used the NOPASSWD trick in sudoers but I've decided to be more secure. Is there any sort of compromise besides allowing no password access to certain apps? (which can still be insecure) Something that will stop malware and remote logins from sudo rm -rf /-ing me, but in my terminals I can type happily away? Can I have this per terminal, perhaps, so just random commands won't make it through? I've tried running the terminal emulations as sudo, but that puts me as root.</p>

"Force firefox to open pages in a specific tab using command line","<p>Here's the challenge: I developed Softphone Screenpop PHP App that takes caller id info and searches for a match in our db, also allows us to collect call statistics. Great for our management but it's driving our reps nuts.</p>

<p>We use Firefox here and when our softphone pops to the external page, every time it opens in a new tab, the girls quickly get 5-10 open and it becomes confusing.</p>

<p>Our softphone will also run command line. I wondering if there is a way to have a URL open in a certain tab. I don't want to disable target=""blank"" links etc, I also don't want to kill the tab the user is working on. Otherwise does anyone have any other ideas?</p>

"Workaround to prevent Facebook ""Like"" cross-domain error?","<p>I've been working on this particular error for a week now, debugging different social buttons and narrowing it down to Facebook in general: every ""Like"" button I've implemented (HTML5, xfbml, etc.) triggers the same cross-domain scripting error. Basically, Facebook is triggering this error with every iFrame (like below) upon clicking ""like"":</p>

<pre><code>Unsafe JavaScript attempt to access frame with URL http://mediacdn.disqus.com/1326940420/build/system/def.html#xdm_e=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.vancitybuzz.com&amp;xdm_c=default4311&amp;xdm_p=1&amp; from frame with URL http://www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?channel_url=https%3A%2F%2Fs-static.ak.fbcdn.net%2Fconnect%2Fxd_proxy.php%3Fversion%3D3%23cb%3Df31a0247d%26origin%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.vancitybuzz.com%252Ff3c0eb7e0c%26relation%3Dparent.parent%26transport%3Dpostmessage&amp;extended_social_context=false&amp;href=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.vancitybuzz.com%2F2012%2F01%2Fchinese-new-year-events-2012-vancouver-richmond-burnaby%2F&amp;layout=box_count&amp;locale=en_US&amp;node_type=link&amp;sdk=joey&amp;send=false&amp;show_faces=false&amp;width=90. Domains, protocols and ports must match.
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Why this isn't a duplicate:</strong> the issue occurs even in the absence of the twitter button and google+ button. it also occurs in every implementation of the ""like"" button. the symptoms point to a new issue.</p>

<p><strong>Methods attempted:</strong> I've tried multiple ""versions"" of the Like button all with the same issue. It's even conflicting with DISQUS.</p>

<p><strong>Suspects:</strong> Pages that do not have any DISQUS code are functioning normally. This variable (output by DISQUS wordpress plugin) is suspect:</p>

<pre><code>var facebookXdReceiverPath = 'http://www.vancitybuzz.com/wp-content/plugins/disqus-comment-system/xd_receiver.htm'; 
</code></pre>

<p>In addition, javascript output by Facebook is also suspect.</p>

"Problem with SelfSSL and Firefox 3","<p>I have a IIS website with a security certificate setup using SelfSSL (part of the IIS Resources toolkit). The certificate appears valid when I view it in ISS and it works fine for IE, Safari and Google Chrome. However, in Firefox 3 it does not consider the certificate valid and therefore shows a certificate warning when you view a secure page on the website.</p>

<p>This is only a problem because I am using Selenium to automatically test the site. I have tried using custom Firefox profiles to solve this problem and this works ok with one IIS site. But when each developer has their own site you have to keep adding exceptions to this custom profile.</p>

<p>I can use other browsers for the Selenium scripts, but I would rather use Firefox (the form input on IE seems to run much slower than Firefox).</p>

<p>I think the easiest way around this problem is to have valid certificates in the first place, hence I started using SelfSSL. Any ideas why Firefox doesn't seem to take any notice?</p>

"Integrating Django project with Facebook","<p>I have a running application, and would like to add new features requring being registered with facebook accounts. Because I would perform some FQL queries later on, the only reasonable solution is pyFacebook (or am I wrong ?). I don't want to create a facebook app, just restrict some content on my site. So I've installed the latest version, and basing on sample project created user models :</p>

<pre><code>from django.db import models
from facebook.djangofb import get_facebook_client

def _2int(d, k):
    try:
        d = d.__dict__
    except:
        pass

    t = d.get(k, '')
    if t == 'None':
        t = 0
    else:
        t = int(t)
    return t

class UserManager(models.Manager):   
    def get_current(self):
        """"""Gets a User object for the logged-in Facebook user.""""""
        facebook = get_facebook_client()
        user, created = self.get_or_create(id=_2int(facebook, 'uid'))
        if created:
            # we could do some custom actions for new users here...
            pass
        return user

class User(models.Model):
    uid = models.IntegerField(primary_key=True)
    objects = UserManager()

<pre><code>from django.http import HttpResponse
from django.views.generic.simple import direct_to_template
from django.utils.decorators import decorator_from_middleware
from django.http import HttpResponse
from django.views.generic.simple import direct_to_template
import facebook.djangofb as facebook
from facebook.djangofb import FacebookMiddleware

@decorator_from_middleware(FacebookMiddleware)
@facebook.require_login()
def myrt(request):
    user = User.objects.get_current()
    return direct_to_template(request, 'rte/my_rt.html', extra_context={'fbuser': user})
</code></pre>

<p>url:</p>

<pre><code>urlpatterns += patterns(""mysite.fb.views"",
    (r'my-rt/$', ""myrt"",),
)
</code></pre>

<p>Now I have two problems :<br>
1. When I try to enter the restricted part of site, I'm being redirected to facebook. Can I open a login popup window like after clicking 'Like' button ?<br>
2. After logging in, I see either a callback error on facebook (if callback url field in my app settings is empty) or I'm redirected back to main site of my app without any possibility to enter the restricted area, since it constantly redirects me to <code>/</code>.</p>

<p>All ideas how to solve any of them are welcome. Also was it the right choice to use pyFacebook instead of ie django-facebook-oauth for my needs ?</p>

"Best Practices for updating a previously unmaintained server RHEL5.7","<p>A new RedHat EL5.6 server has been recently put under my care.  It is immediately obvious that, for the previous 12 months, little to no attention has been given to any sort of package updates.</p>

<p>Typically I am of the mindset of if it isn't broke - don't fix it.  However, after registering the server with RHN, and also using the yum-security plugin to check security updates, there are just over 1100 ""security"" updates available.</p>

<p>Has anybody had a similar situation?  I am reluctant to just update everything, as I like to know what is being updated and whether or not it has the potential to impact anything running on the box (this is a production server).  However, it also looks like keeping in line with this practice would require me to go through 1100 package errata line by line.  Is there a more efficient solution?</p>

"Firefox won't remember passwords, and throws weird javascript exceptions","<p>Two days ago Firefox started throwing strange javascript errors
e.g.</p>

<p>It's throwing these on every page on every site I visit.</p>

<p>If I browse to a site that requires http authentication (e.g. <a href=""http://seo.dizzyheights.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://seo.dizzyheights.com</a> - one of our test sites), the authentication dialog no longer includes the ""Remember this password"" checkbox, even though I'm not in Private Browsing mode, and ""Remember passwords for sites"" is still ticked in the Firefox options. It also throws an even bigger javascript error:</p>

<pre><code>Error: LoginManagerPrompter: Epic fail in promptAuth: [Exception...

"Several xml errors using Facebook JS SDK with xhtml strict","<p>I'm trying to set up some like buttons to a project. These buttons live inside a jquery slideshow with Aino's Galleria and let you ""Like"" each different slide. I'm using an xHTML strict document and while in Firefox (and Firebug) everything seems ok, but in webkit inspector I get this:</p>

<pre><code>   XML self-closing tag syntax used on &lt;fb:like&gt;. The tag will not be closed.
   [The HTML that caused this error was generated by a script.] XML self-closing tag syntax used on &lt;fb:like&gt;. The tag will not be closed.

<pre><code>&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
//&lt;![CDATA[
document.write('&lt;fb:like href=""&lt;?php echo ""http://www.site/image-"".$image_id ;?&gt;"" width=""260"" height=""80"" show_faces=""false"" /&gt;');
//]]&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;

<p>The above, still works in Firefox, but not in <strong>Safari</strong>. The inspector says:</p>

<pre><code>26 XFBML tags failed to render in 30000ms.

<p>Moreover, for the Facebook like buttons to work with the <strong>Galleria</strong> Jquery plugin, I have a custom function that reloads only the facebook like button concerning the actual slide which appears briefly upon loading the slide:</p>

<pre><code>[...]
extend: function(options) {
       // listen to when an image is shown
       this.bind(Galleria.IMAGE, function(e) {
            number = e.index + 1;

    $(tag).each(function() {
            FB.XFBML.parse( this );
        });
    });

"Is it possible to send a request to the Facebook Graph API from client side without exposing our access token to the public?","<p>My question is related to, but not exactly, <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7633234/get-public-page-statuses-using-facebook-graph-api-without-access-token"">this question</a>.</p>

<p>I am currently working on a business directory Web site (similar to Yelp), in which businesses have their own pages. Let's call this app <code>DIRECTORY_APP</code>.</p>

<p>Businesses might want to have their latest Facebook status update shown on their pages hosted on our directory. Let's pretend we have a business named <code>BIZ_1</code>. The assumption is that those pages are public pages.</p>

<p>Apparently the Facebook Graph API can be used for this purpose. So I can send a request to Facebook to retrieve the latest status updates for <code>BIZ_1</code>:</p>

<pre><code>https://graph.facebook.com/BIZ_1_PROFILE_ID/posts?
        access_token=DIRECTORY_APP_ACCESS_TOKEN
        &amp;callback=callbackName
</code></pre>

<p>However, if I use this from the client side, our Web site's access token will be exposed to the public, so this is not a reasonable solution.</p>

<p>Now in the <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7633234/get-public-page-statuses-using-facebook-graph-api-without-access-token"">aforementioned question</a>, Anatoly mentions that we can retrieve the access token by sending this request first:</p>

<pre><code>https://graph.facebook.com/oauth/access_token?
        client_id=YOUR_APP_ID&amp;client_secret=YOUR_APP_SECRET
        &amp;grant_type=client_credentials
</code></pre>

<p>However if someone inspects the Network log, this will also expose our Web site's access token (is this correct or is this a different type of access token?). This solution also exposes our web site's app secret (is this safe?).</p>

<p>So to summarize, what's a safe way in which I can retrieve the latest status update of a Web page from client-side without asking the browsing user to first log in to Facebook?</p>

"facebook app doesn't authenticate on canvas","<p>I've made my facebook app. It starts with asking the user to authenticate.
After the user has authenticated the app the app works as I have designed it.</p>

<p>All steps in the process are working on my webserver. However when the application is framed into facebook, it requires authentication, the user clicks the authentication button and then nothing happens....</p>

<p>When the user has already authenticated the app, there is no problem and it also works in teh facebook canvas. So what is wrong?</p>

<p>My app is at <a href=""https://facebook.winboodschappen.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://facebook.winboodschappen.com</a> and should do its work at <a href=""https://apps.facebook.com/winboodschappen"" rel=""nofollow"">https://apps.facebook.com/winboodschappen</a></p>

"Picture not posted to Facebook (even if Id returned, .i.e: successful)","<p>I am trying to make an app that upload a photo (byte array) to facebook. I searched a lot of code online and my code is no different.</p>

<p>here is a sample code</p>

<pre><code>params = new Bundle();
params.putByteArray(""picture"", imgData); // imgData is bytearray of the image to post
params.putString(""message"",  ""some message"");
response = facebook.request(""me/photos"", params, ""POST"");
</code></pre>

<p>When i try to post the picture (according to Facebook: they should create an album for my app) but no album is created and no picture is posted. furthermore the response i get is something like:
{""id"":""3014021866xxxx"",""post_id"":""10000247042xxxx_30139987661xxxx""} (x represents some numbers that i removed for this post)</p>

<p>There is another issue actually, it used to work ok, but then i deleted the album (as part of testing) created by facebook for my app and now i can't upload any photo to facebook.</p>

<p>so from the response above it looks like the picture is successfully posted, however when i check the user profile on facebook, no picture is posted and no album is created.</p>

"Storing facebook token for offline access","<p>I am looking for a way to save the access token to allow the user to post on facebook without having to log in for each call to the graph API :</p>

<p>I require an offline_access token, i store it in the NSUserDefaults, but when i try to use it again i get a FacebookErrDomain error 10000</p>

<p>Here is what i do :</p>

<p>In the fbDidLogin i get the access_token and save it in the user defaults </p>

<pre><code>- (void)fbDidLogin {
    NSString *token = self.facebook.accessToken;
    [[NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults] setObject:token forKey:@""facebookToken""];

}
</code></pre>

<p>After that when i run the app again i just get the token from the user defaults, and assign them to the facebook object :</p>

<pre><code>NSString *token = [[NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults] objectForKey:@""facebookToken""];
[_facebook setAccessToken:token];
</code></pre>

<p>But it doesn't work..</p>

<p>Has anybody any idea what i could be doing wrong ?</p>

<p>Thanks,
Vincent.</p>

If i do a NSlog after <code>[[NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults] objectForKey:@""facebookToken""];</code> i can see that the token was saved.</p>

<p>i.e. : in all my php pages, is it supposed to have </p>

"How should login bans work?","<p>I have set up a login system. If your maximum quota of <em>failed attempts per IP or per username</em> is exceeded, the login page will ask you to solve a captcha until you log in. I thought to remove all records when the user successfully logs in (removes the records which have your IP <strong>or</strong> your username). However, this has a flaw.</p>

<p>Suppose this is the <code>attempts</code> table.</p>

<pre><code>       IP | Username
----------+---------
127.0.0.1 |  jeff

<p>Now, suppose the client <code>127.0.0.1</code> logs in with the username <code>atwood</code>. Now, there are no more records about him: he can keep bruteforcing the other user without having to deal with captchas.</p>

"Macro - Copy and Paste","<p>My company only uses MS Office 2003 products so I have to stick to it. Because of the nature of my job, i need to use a lot of ""copy and paste"" function. The source data is mostly from the website and i paste the data into a cell in Excel. The problem is clipboard keeps source formatting and it reflects on the cell when i paste it. That is really troublesome to remove the source format by selecting option ""Paste as Text"" every time i user copy and paste. SO i decided to use Macro. The Macro works perfectly when i try to copy and paste from website to excel, but when i copy and paste from Excel to the same work Sheet it throws an error.</p>

<p>This is the code i use for copy and paste from website to excel without source formatting.</p>

<pre><code>Sub Paste_without_any_formatting()
    ActiveSheet.PasteSpecial Format:=""Text""
End Sub
</code></pre>

<p>I want to add another code for copy and paste from excel to the same work Sheet like this.</p>

<pre><code>Selection.PasteSpecial Paste:=xlPasteValues, Operation:=xlNone, SkipBlanks _
    :=False, Transpose:=False
</code></pre>

<p>How can i put these two codes together? I want to make these happen magically when i press Ctrl+V. Can anyone help me?</p>

"How to know which request a FB Graph's response respond to?","<p>I make a call to FB graph api using FB IOS and handle the response in a delegate object which conforms to FBRequestDelegate. The handle functions is</p>

<p>My question is that how do I know which request this response respond to if two requests with same graph path are made?</p>

"Direct Parameter Access not working, using printf in C","<p>I am doing some computer security research, and I am trying to learn about string format vulnerabilities.  I am running a program that contains this code:</p>

<pre><code>char buf[1&lt;&lt;5];
strncpy(buf, data, sizeof(buf));
buf[sizeof(buf)-1]='\0';
fprintf(stderr, buf);
</code></pre>

<p>When I feed the program the argument ""%08x.%08x.%08x.%08x.%08x"" (which gets read into the ""data"" variable), I get the output:
00000020.b7fd7560.08048b09.00000019.78383025</p>

<p>I understand that each hex number is popped off the stack, and the ""78383025"" comes from the buffer itself.  So there are 4 words--16 bytes--that I have to pop off before I get to the start of my buffer. </p>

<p>When I give the argument <code>`perl -e 'print ""\x2a\xf9\xff\xbf%08x.%08x.%08x.%08x_%s_"";'`</code>, the %s part prints the string located at memory address 0xbffff92a.</p>

<p>Now, I'd like to do this using direct parameter access.  If I feed the program the argument <code>`perl -e 'print ""\x2a\xf9\xff\xbf%16$s"";'`</code>, I should expect the program to do the same thing as above.  But all the program prints is the four characters at the start of the buffer.  So, what gives???  Am I using the wrong syntax for DPA???
I am using Ubuntu 9.04, 32-bit by the way.</p>

<p>Here is some compilable code, not guaranteed to produce the same results though:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

void run(const char* data) {
    char buf[1&lt;&lt;5];
    strncpy(buf, data, sizeof(buf));

"What is the best way to transfer a file via email easily and securely?","<p>I went to my tax adviser today and have to send in some more files. I want to send them encrypted by email.

<p>I would like to sketch out an idea, and hear your opinion on it:</p>

<p>Suppose we created a (cross platform) application, that encrypts a file securely and prints the key to it as a 2D barcode. This barcode can easily be faxed to the receiving party while the file can be send by email. The same application is capable of interpreting the barcode image (e.g. using a webcam snap) and decrypting the file.</p>

"Hashing, adding more salt","<p>Ok, so I understand why salting a password prior to hashing is such a good idea.
The question is, normally people suggest appending or prepending the salt to the password, why not do both?</p>

<p>My thinking is, so if Mr hacker got hold of the DB and wants to get the password for person x,
he thinks to himself, well most people suggest appending or prepending the salt, so lets do that..
He generates a rainbow table with of all the combinations of password + salt, and tries his luck. If that doesn't work he does the same but salt + password.</p>

<p>To make much it more difficult to do the attack why don't developers go the step further and do 'salt + password + salt', or 'reverse(salt) + password + salt', or you could be fancy and start cutting up the password/salt, start putting bits of salt here and there etc.</p>

<p>The only way the hacker would be able to find the password is if he has access to the source code (to know how the salt was weaved into the password prior to hashing)</p>

<p>A further note is, people suggest doing a minimum of 1000 iterations when key-stretching, again why not 1147, 1652, etc :)</p>

"Excel VBA - How to Copy Column and Paste Values to a New Column Every Time Macro Is Initiated","<p>I currently have a spreadsheet that calculates variances in column Z. At the end of the month I would like to copy and paste the values into another column in the same spreadsheet to keep track of the variances month to month. I have developed a macro that copies the contents that need to be copied from column Z to column BK. Right now every time I run the macro it copies column Z and pastes it into column BK. What I really would like to happen is that each time I run the macro I want it to copy the values from column Z and paste it into a new column using the following schedule:</p>

<ul>
<li>Month 1 = Values Should be Pasted in Column BK </li>
<li>Month 2 = Values Should be Pasted in Column BL</li>
<li>Month 3 = Values Should be Pasted in Column BM</li>
<li>Month 4 = Values Should be Pasted in Column BN</li>
<li>Month 5 = Values Should be Pasted in Column BO</li>
<li>Month 6 = Values Should be Pasted in Column BP</li>
<li>Month 7 = Values Should be Pasted in Column BQ</li>
<li>Month 8 = Values Should be Pasted in Column BR</li>
<li>Month 9 = Values Should be Pasted in Column BS</li>
<li>Month 10 = Values Should be Pasted in Column BT</li>
<li>Month 11 = Values Should be Pasted in Column BU</li>
<li>Month 12 = Values Should be Pasted in Column BV</li>
</ul>

<p>After the 12th iteration, I would like the values from column Z to be copied into Column BK (the starting point). I believe this can be done using a loop? My issue is that I am having a difficult time coming up with the loop logic/coding. Please see my code below... Any help you have would be greatly appreciated.</p>

Nobody can modify the JSOn return value unless they hack my server, in which case I would have a much larger problem anyway.

"Android and Facebook Like action with Open Graph object","<p>Facebook like action has been released for mobile apps.</p>

<p>As the documentation says :</p>

<pre><code>To publish a built-in Like action on an Open Graph object,
invoke the following HTTP POST request with a user’s access
token and the url of the Open Graph object.
This Open Graph object can be of any type.

curl -X POST \
    -F 'access_token=USER_ACCESS_TOKEN' \
    -F 'object=OG_OBJECT_URL' \
    https://graph.facebook.com/[User FB ID]/og.likes
</code></pre>

<p>Usually, to make a request e.g for user info, I use this kind of code:</p>

<pre><code>Facebook facebook;
facebook = new Facebook(AppConfig.FACEBOOK_APP_ID);

if (facebook.isSessionValid())
{
    JSONObject obj = facebook.request(""me"");
    ...
}
else
{
    facebook.authorize(...)

The comment box shows up and works exactly as I want it to, but when I go to facebook debugger <a href=""http://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug</a> it tells me that none of the required open graph meta tags (og:title, etc.) are set.

I'm running PHP 5.2.9, and I have NO access to upgrading or editing it at all.  (University environment, they're a trifle slow and obfuscating when asking for server changes.)  I've found multiple questions on Stack Overflow along similar lines, and have tried implementing all the suggested fixes to no avail, any help would be appreciated!</p>

<p>Please let me know if I left out any needed info!  I'm getting quite frustrated here, it took about 3 minutes flat to get the facebook comments to work, and now hours and hours of work still haven't resolved this issue. . .</p>

"Javascript Regex - Strip out parameter from listed function","<p>I am trying to build a jquery plugin that locate excel formula and evaluate it, currently using <a href=""http://zaach.github.io/jison/"" rel=""nofollow"">jison</a> as parser and some regex for placeholder replacement, and the problem is I am blind about those two, the full code currently is in <a href=""https://github.com/ikhsan017/calx"" rel=""nofollow"">github</a></p>

<p>What I want to do:</p>

<p>Say I have a registered formula member and it's function</p>

<pre><code>var formula = {
    member:['MAX','MIN','AVG','SUM'],
    max:function(cell1,cell2){
        ...
        //return the max
    }
    //.... and other function not listed
}
</code></pre>

<p>and have an HTML element with data-formula attribute</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div data-formula=""MAX($A1,$A5)""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>if the variable placeholder $A1 acted as parameter of listed formula (MAX,MIN,SUM, and AVG) it should replaced by 1.1 (convert A to 1 and concatenate with dot), and if it outside the formula bracket, it should kept remain and will be replaced later (if you could help build jison file that make the MAX() accept string, that would be great :) )</p>

<p>my current code is look like below</p>

<pre><code>var $equation = '';
var $formula_regex  = new RegExp('['+formula.member.join('|')+']+\(([^]+)\)','g');
//should be [SUM|AVG|MAX|MIN]+\(([^]+)\)

//this.data[$key].formula contains the string formula
$equation  = this.data[$key].formula.replace($formula_regex,function($range){
$range = $range.replace(/\$\w+/g, function($key) {
    $key = $key.replace('$','');

        //utility.translaceCell will convert B23 to 2.23, C2 to 3.2 etc
    $key = utility.translateCell($key,'string');
    return $key;
});
    return($range);
});
</code></pre>

<p>above regex work as expected when it contain single formula like MAX($B1,$B3)</p>

<pre><code>MAX($B1,$B3) 
//translated to MAX(2.1,2.3)
</code></pre>

<p>but not work when contain more complex formula</p>

<pre><code>IF($B1 &gt; 3,SUM($B1,$B3),MIN($B1,$B3))
//translated to IF(2.1 &gt; 3,SUM(2.1,2.3),MIN(2.1,2.3))
//expected IF($B1 &gt; 3,SUM(2.1,2.3),MIN(2.1,2.3))

"Loosely securing Linux for students to learn on","<p>At school, we have a computer that is only for students to login to and do computer science related activities, such as compiling C and C++ programs for classes. It was running some obscure flavor of linux that was put on many many years before I took it over. I have recently installed Ubuntu Server on it to make it more maintainable and secure. Currently we set up user accounts as needed. Students ssh login and complete assignments for class and each user stores their work and play in their home folder. The instructors will have the students leave their work in a certain folder for submitting or something like that. </p>

<p>My concern is a user that gets too exploratory and explores or someone maliciously trashes it and breaks something, thereby causing no one else to be able to get any work done, and results in the faculty complaining to me and making me look like a bad sysadmin for not preventing this. (I am still an undergrad and at their mercy)</p>

<p>The students are currently in their own group, and can only see their own home folder / can't browse other students folders. Faculty have more advanced accounts but not admin accounts.

And I just echo the whole thing. </p>

<p>The method is set up this way:</p>

<pre><code>private function feed ($var)
{
    $Statement = $this-&gt;Database-&gt;prepare(""SELECT * FROM feed WHERE col = ? ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 50"");
    $Statement-&gt;execute(array($var));

    }

<p>The class is set up so that another method that has more of the html template calls this feed method. (I'm not trying to be too redundant here, but again the last time I asked this question it got down voted).  So I'm pretty new to oop, and I'm looking to display the profile pictures of people who are logged in with facebook. This isn't necessarily a facebook question because I know how to do it normally, but I don't know how to get the facebook information within the class scope using just their id. Normally I;d get their picture by going linking to this url <a href=""https://graph.facebook.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://graph.facebook.com/</a>/picture. How do I do this within the class when I only sotre their facebook id in the database? I've been working on this problem for a couple days now, and I can't figure it out on my own. So I really appreciate your help.</p>

<p>It's getting to the point where I just want to statically type everything out because I know I could easily do that, but I'd really love to learn what the proper way is, especially since editing so many of these little boxes if I want to change something one day would be a real hassle.

"Post to Facebook not working from delegate","<p>I have added FBSdk in my project along with SBJson classes, what files should i import in my second view controller to work my code ?</p>

<p>I want to post on Fb using the description under url so for that i need to include this code into my second view controller, but i am stuck in a part i founded that the below code should be added in the second view controller but the ""delegate:self"" not works, as i am doing this first time so can any one guide me how should i code in my second view controller keeping into account the values from the app delegate (How should i get the values from the app delegate of FB to the second view so that i can add this code in second code plz can any one correct this code) </p>

<pre><code>facebook = [[Facebook alloc] initWithAppId:@""YOUR_APP_ID""]; 
</code></pre>

<p><strong>// how should i take this id from the app delegate ?</strong></p>

<pre><code> NSArray* permissions =  [NSArray arrayWithObjects:@""read_stream"", 
 @""publish_stream"", nil];
[facebook authorize:permissions delegate:self];

   NSMutableDictionary* params = [[NSMutableDictionary alloc] 
initWithCapacity:1]
 [params setObject:@""Testing"" forKey:@""name""];

"debugging the infinite loop after authorization with javascript sdk","<p>As per usual, FB has me pulling out my hair.</p>

<p>I've been able to test my app in IE9, but when using Firefox, after a user authorizes the canvas app it goes into a redirect loop, adding state and code variables to the URL.</p>

<p>I'm using the javascript and php sdk with this code:</p>

<pre><code>$facebook = new Facebook(array(
'appId'  =&gt; $app_id,
'secret' =&gt; $application_secret,
'cookie' =&gt; true, // enable optional cookie support
));
$user = $facebook-&gt;getUser();
if(!($user))
{

=&gt; $fbconfig['appBaseUrl'],
'scope' =&gt; 'manage_notifications,publish_stream,publish_actions'
)) . ""'&lt;/script&gt;"";
exit();

<p>The error occurs (according to the stacktrace) at the line where I write ""workbook.write(fileOut)"" where fileOut is a FileOutputStream.  That implies that there's obviously enough memory for ALL of the java objects to store the excel file, but for some reason as it's writing to the hard disk it must grab a whole lot more memory.</p>

<p>Just to tell you, I have attempted to increase the java heap size up until 1 gig (by adding -Xms128m -Xmx1024m) but that still doesn't seem to do the tric.</p>

"Any bad side effects to window.onbeforeunload returning no value?","<p>I know that in Chrome and FF, if window.onbeforeunload returns null, then the dialog box will not pop up.  But in IE, it pops up with the message 'null'.  In order to make IE not create a pop-up, window.onbeforeunload should return nothing.  But does returning nothing have any other side effects in Chrome and FF?  If not, why would anyone bother to write 'return null;' in the first place?</p>

<p>For example, do this:</p>

<pre><code>window.onbeforeunload = function() { 
  if (shouldNotWarnBeforeUnload)
    { return null; }
  else 
    { return ('Are you sure you want to leave the page?'); }
  return null;

"Restrict group permissions on OS X networked home folders?","<p>It was brought to my attention recently the user's home folders on our server have group read permissions.</p>

<p>The subfolders within them - Documents, Movies, Pictures, etc. do not have group permissions, but any files and directories created at the top level in the home folder itself have group read permissions.</p>

<p>(If these were local accounts on a client machine, then each user would be in their own group, thus naturally restricting group access.)</p>

<p>What's the best way to fix current home folders now and to remove group read permissions for all future accounts that are created?  I noticed each home folder currently has an ACL ""group:everybody deny delete"", could I add another ACL as a quick fix?</p>

"Firefox 4 autocomplete=off functionality","<p>I have two sites, both under the same domain.
I have set autocomplete=""off"" for a login field in one site (site 1), and not for another site (Site 2).</p>

<p>When I fill out the login field in Site 2, firefox asks me if I would like to remember them and I say yes.
I then return to Site 1 and select the down arrow in a login field that I have the autocomplete set to 'off'. It displays the login details I saved in Site 2. I don't want this.</p>

<p>Is there a way to prevent this happening?

"security precautions to take when running multiple sub-sites on the same main site","<p>I have shared hosting, and within my own user space I run three different .com domains. One serves as the actual hosting plan master domain, and the other are subs via URL redirects and domain pointing.</p>

If the blog itself gets trashed, I'm not going to lose any sleep over it. But if the other sites get nailed I'll be a pretty sad panda.</p>

"Why do I need to perform server side validation?","<p>Thanks to everyone who commented or posted an answer!  I've kept my original question and update below for completeness.  </p>

<p>[Feb 16, 2011 - Update 2] As some people point out - my question should have been: <strong>Given a standard asp.net 4 form, if I don't have any server side validation, what types of malicious attacks am I susceptible to?</strong></p>

<p>Here is my take away on this issue.  </p>

<ul>
<li>If data isn't sensitive <em>(comments on a page)</em> - from an asp.net security standpoint, following standard best practices (SqlParameters, request validation enabled, etc) will protect you from malicious attacks.</li>
<li>For sensitive data/applications - it's up to you to decide what type of server side validation is appropriate for your application.  You need to think the end to end solution (webservices, other systems, etc).  You can view a number of suggestions below - whitelist validation, etc.  </li>
<li>If you are using ajax (xhr requests) to post user input you need to reproduce the protection from the other bullets in your code on the server.  Again, lots of solutions below – like ensuring that the data does not contain any html/code, etc.  <em>(side note: the .net framework requestValidationMode=""4.0"" does afford some protection in this regard - but I can't speak to how complete a solution it is)</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Please feel free to continue to comment...if any of the above is incorrect please let me know.  Thanks!</p>

<hr>

<p>[Feb 3, 2011 - Update 1] I want to thank everyone for their answers!  Perhaps I should ask the reverse question:</p>

<p>Assume a simple asp.net 4.0 web form <em>(formview + datasource with request validation enabled)</em> that allows logged in users to post comments to a public page <em>(comments stored in sql server db table)</em>.  What type of data validation or cleansing should I perform on the new ""comments"" on the server side?</p>

<hr>

<p>[Jan 19, 2011 - Original Question] Our asp.net 4 website has a few forms where users can submit data and we use jquery validate on the client side.  Users have to be logged in with a valid account to access these forms.  </p>

<p>I understand that our client side validation rules could easily be bypassed and clients could post data without required fields, etc.  This doesn’t concern me very much - users have to be logged in and I don’t consider our data very “sensitive” nor would I say any of our validation is “critical”.  The input data is written to the database using SqlParameters (to defend against sql injection) and we depend on asp.net request validation to defend against potentially dangerous html input. </p>

<p>Is it really worth our time to rewrite the various jquery validation rules on the server?  Specifically how could a malicious user compromise our server or what specific attacks could we be open to?  </p>

<p>I apologize as it appears that this question has been discussed a few times on this site – but I have yet to find an answer that cites specific risks or issues with not performing server side validation.  Thanks in advance</p>

"Secure API Authentication","<p>I'm creating my own API for a game-statistics system (in PHP).
And I want users to be able to log-in to the system from their game.</p>

<p>Basically, the game is made with GM:HTML5 (GameMaker for HTML5) which means it's only obfuscated, but still readable with any JavaScript debugger.</p>

<p>For it to work, users will have to include a PHP library which will connect to my API system.
But, I want to limit access by using API Keys.</p>

<p>If I would send the API key with the request, it will be visible (eg. by using Firefox's Developer Console). And with that API key, anyone could ""log-in"" and submit statistics data.</p>

<p>What I'd like to do, is send the domain where the game is hosted, in encrypted form with the login request. (Just a simple GET request to the server from my PHP library). And then the server would have to decrypt that string (the encrypted domain / IP) and check if it matches the API key which was also send with the request.</p>

"Dangerous to store a well hashed password and the method used to hash it in plain sight?","<p>I am developing a client-side application in C# that will communicate with a server (php page) for credentials and for some critical services. I am wondering if it's dangerous to store a well hashed password on the client's machine? By ""well hashed"", I mean with a random seed using a well-known secure hashing function. For the purposes of this discussion, assume the source is freely available (as all binaries can be reverse engineered).</p>

<p>My thought was that I would store the username and hashed password on the user's computer and that this username and hash would be sent in plain text over an unencrypted http connection to the server for validation. This of course will not prevent a hacker from using someone else's username and password hash as their own without knowing the source password (with some code tweaks).</p>

<ol>
<li>Would a malevolent individual be able to do anything with a hashed password and code used to produce the hash? (other than log in as an other user if they obtained this information)</li>
<li>What do other client-side applications do to prevent one user from logging in as an other user, if the hacker does not have access to the source password? (for example Steam)</li>
<li>Is there an easy, cheap (both cost and time), more secure way to handle this?</li>
</ol>

<p>Example of how a hacker would spoof someone else's login credentials using my current logic:</p>

<ol>
<li>Legit user signs in for the first time, credentials get stored</li>
<li>Hacker gains access to the file system, locates username and hashed password</li>
<li>Hacker modifies source code (or uses code injection) to send the acquired username and hashed password instead of what the program would normally do</li>
</ol>

<p>The product I am producing is not going to be the next ebay, facebook, or stackexchange, and is low budget. I do not need something top notch, and don't care for thefts as I am planing to use a ""Pay What You Want"" model. I am mainly posting this for curiosity's sake.</p>

"Linking MS Excel to MS Access queries","<p>I have an Access database that I use to to run a bunch of aggregate TOP 5 queries. The end game of this particular function is ppt presentations with charts. So to automate this a bit, I created an excel spreadsheet with a bunch of pre-made charts in it. The I linked/data imported the query results into the excel spreadsheet, and set the cell ranges to match the source ranges for the charts. Finally I set the spreadsheet to enable auto refresh upon every ""file open"", and presto, I run the queries in access with a button press, then open the excel file, and the data refreshes, and they are my charts. I then use some VB to copy paste all active charts into ppt, but that is another matter.</p>

<p>Okay so here is the snag I hit. I needed to do the exact same procedure with another spreadsheet from another ag query. Before the process I was using was just clicking data > import external data > import data and then choosing the file of the database, and then it would populate a list of tables and queries to choose from. Only now, it will not show any queries in that populated list; only tables!?!</p>

"Posting to Facebook OG with HTTParty only works from the rails console?","<p>I'm having a really weird problem with my rails app and facebook's open graph beta. Whenever I post an action to an object, Facebook returns an error that seems to indicate the URL of the object can't be reached, or the og scraper isn't scraping the URL correctly.</p>

<p>However, when I take the URL the app is generating for the post to Facebook and manually use the HTTParty gem to post it, it works.</p>

<p>Here's my code:</p>

<pre><code>class Post &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  FB_CONFIG = YAML.load_file(""#{Rails.root}/config/initializers/facebook.yml"")[Rails.env]

  def self.to_facebook_og(obj, obj_id, verb, auth, extra)
    #requires that a user has granted `publish_actions`
    found_obj = obj.classify.constantize.find(obj_id) #find the actual object we're talking about
    post_url = self.construct_facebook_action_url(obj, found_obj, verb, auth, extra) #create the URL
    begin
      ret = HTTParty.post(post_url)
      logger.info ""Facebook Post Action Response = #{ret}""
    rescue HTTParty::ResponseError =&gt; e #handle any errors
      logger.error {""FACEBOOK Response #{ret.code} / #{e.inspect}""}
      flash.alert {""There was a Facebook problem. Please try again.""}
      return
    end
  end

  def self.construct_facebook_action_url(obj, found_obj, verb, auth, extra)
    base = 'https://graph.facebook.com/'
    uid = auth.uid
    namespace = FB_CONFIG['namespace']
    token = ""?access_token=#{auth.token}""
    og_url = ""#{obj}=http://theshortestfiction.com/#{obj.pluralize}/#{found_obj.id}""
    fb_url = base + uid + '/' + namespace + ':' + verb + token + '&amp;' + og_url + extra
    logger.info fb_url
    fb_url
  end

  def self.lint_og_object(obj_url)
   lint_ret = HTTParty.post(""https://developers.facebook.com/tools/lint/?url=#{obj_url}&amp;format=json"")
   logger.info ""Facebook Linter Response = #{lint_ret}""
  end



end
</code></pre>

<p>When an object is read via its controller's show method, the app calls <code>Post.to_facebook</code>. From my logs, I can see that that <code>Post.construct_facebook_action_url</code> is constructing the proper url (because like I said, I can pull the URL from the logs and manually post it from the console). So, I'm assuming there's so problem with how I'm passing the URL to HTTParty? Facebook seems able to tell what object URL it <em>should</em> be looking at. Why does the code I've written not work, but manually in the console, it does?</p>

<p>Even weirder -- once there's been a sucessful post action on the object once, the code seems to work consistently. Facebook <em>insists</em> the problem is that the objects' URLs aren't reachable, but I can't understand how they're not, since I can browse to them.</p>

"Two vertical scrollbars in Firefox when using overflow-x:hidden","<p>Ive just built a website for a client, and Ive got an odd problem that only occurs in Firefox browser. </p>

<p>At the top of the page I have a navigation bar that fills the width of the browser. Ive used the technique described here <a href=""http://css-tricks.com/full-browser-width-bars/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://css-tricks.com/full-browser-width-bars/</a> to achieve the effect as semantically as possible. Then Ive had to place overflow-x:hidden on the html and body tags to prevent the user from being able to scroll off the right side of the screen. </p>

<p>This works great in every browser I've tested it in from Safari on Mac/PC, Opera, Chrome and heaven forbid, but even IE7, 8 &amp; 9 wanted to play nice. But oh no Firefox just doesn't want to go along with it. </p>

<p>Although Ive no horizontal scroll bars which is the desired effect, Firefox has decided to double up on the amount of vertical scrollbars. I can't scroll horizontally if using a mouse, but when I use the trackpad on the Mac, the vertical movement is restricted, meaning I cant scroll down  the page and if I do a two finger swipe the page scrolls off horizontally into oblivion. </p>

<p>The only thing I have found on google and elsewhere is that this behaviour is a bug in Firefox? </p>

<p>Any help with this annoyance is greatly appreciated, Many Thanks.</p>

<p><strong>Update: Added Code</strong></p>

<p>Basically the code is this as theres too much show it all. I would point you to the site but the client doesn't want it live yet. Here we go:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;nav id=""menu""&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Menu Item 1&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Menu Item 2&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Menu Item 3&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/nav&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Then the css is this for a fullwidth browser bar as the link above:</p>

<pre><code>html,body{
    overflow-x: hidden; /*This prevents the user from scrolling horizontally*/
}

#menu{
    position: relative;
    background: blue;
}

#menu:before, #menu:after{
    content:'';
    position: absolute;
    background: inherit;
    top: 0;
    bottom: 0;
    width: 9999px; /*huge width to ensure bar fills browser*/
}

#menu:before{
    right: 100%;
}

#menu:after{
    left: 100%;
}

"Excel UDF calculation should return 'original' value","<p>I've been struggling with a VBA problem for a while now and I'll try to explain it as thoroughly as possible.</p>

<p>I have created a VSTO plugin with my own RTD implementation that I am calling from my Excel sheets. To avoid having to use the full-fledged RTD syntax in the cells, I have created a UDF that hides that API from the sheet.
The RTD server I created can be enabled and disabled through a button in a custom Ribbon component. </p>

<p>The behavior I want to achieve is as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>If the server is <strong>disabled</strong> and a reference to my function is entered in a cell, I want the cell to display <code>Disabled</code></li>
<li>If the server is <strong>disabled</strong>, but the function had been entered in a cell when it was enabled (and the cell thus displays a value), I want the cell to keep displaying that value</li>
<li>If the server is <strong>enabled</strong>, I want the cell to display <code>Loading</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Sounds easy enough. Here is an example of the - non functional - code:</p>

<pre><code>Public Function RetrieveData(id as Long)
  Dim result as String

  // This returns either 'Disabled' or 'Loading'
  result = Application.Worksheet.Function.RTD(""SERVERNAME"", """", id)
  RetrieveData = result

  If(result = ""Disabled"") Then

    // Obviously, this recurses (and fails), so that's not an option
    If(Not IsEmpty(Application.Caller.Value2)) Then

      // So does this
      RetrieveData = Application.Caller.Value2

    End If

  End If
End Function
</code></pre>

<p>The function will be called in thousands of cells, so storing the 'original' values in another data structure would be a major overhead and I would like to avoid it. Also, the RTD server does not know the values, since it also does not keep a history of it, more or less for the same reason.</p>

<p>I was thinking that there might be some way to exit the function which would force it to not change the displayed value, but so far I have been unable to find anything like that.</p>

<p>Any ideas on how to solve this are greatly appreciated!</p>

<p>Thanks,
Che</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong><br>
Due to popular demand, some additional info on why I want to do all this:
As I said, the function will be called in thousands of cells and the RTD server needs to retrieve quite a bit of information. This can be quite hard on both network and CPU. To allow the user to decide for himself whether he wants this load on his machine, he or she can disable the updates from the server. In that case, he or she should still be able to calculate the sheets with the values currently in the fields, yet no updates are pushed into them. Once new data is required, the server can be enabled and the fields will be updated.</p>

<p>Again, since we are talking about quite a bit of data here, I would rather not store it somewhere in the sheet. Plus, the data should be usable even if the workbook is closed and loaded again.</p>

"Designing a persistent asynchronous TCP protocol","<p>I have got a collection of web sites that need to send time-sensitive messages to host machines all over my metro area, each on its own generally dynamic IP. Until now, I have been doing this the way of the script kiddie:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Each host machine runs an (s)FTP server, or an HTTP(s) server, and correspondingly has a certain port opened up by its gateway.</p></li>
<li><p>Each host machine runs a program that watches a certain folder and automatically opens or prints or exec()s when a new file of a given extension shows up. Dynamic IP addresses are accommodated using a dynamic DNS service.</p></li>
<li><p>Each web site does cURL or fsockopen or whatever and communicates directly with its recipient as-needed.</p></li>
</ol>

<hr>

<p>This approach has been suprisingly reliable, however obvious issues have come up and the situation needs to be addressed.</p>

<p>As stated, these messages are time-sensitive and failures need to be detected within minutes of submission by end-users. What I'm doing is building a messaging protocol. It will run on a machine and connection in my control. As far as the service is concerned, there is no distinction between web site and host machine -- there is only one device sending a message to another device.</p>

<p>So that's where I'm at right now. I've got a skeleton server and a skeleton client. They can negotiate high-quality authentication and encryption. The (TCP) connection is persistent and asynchronous, and can handle delimited (i.e., read until <em>\r\n</em> or whatever) as well as length-prefixed (i.e., read exactly <em>n</em> bytes) messages. Unless somebody gives me a better idea, I think I'll handle messages as byte arrays.</p>

<hr>

<p>So I'm looking for suggestions on how to model the protocol itself -- at the application level. I'll mostly be transferring XML and DLM type files, as well as control messages for things like ""handshake"" and ""is so-and-so online?"" and so forth. Is there anything really stupid in my train of thought? Or anything I should read about before I get started? Stuff like that -- please and thanks.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>@mrdenny's is the approach I have ultimately gone with, so he gets the answer. @Henrik's ZeroMQ suggestion applied as well, but I basically had that coded already and switching my code for a 3rd party framework didn't really help to design the application layer. In the end, I have discovered just how incredibly versatile HTTP can be, and there is really no need for a roll-your-own protocol. Simply let the web sites present content-type application/json (or xml if necessary) in addition to the text/html they were already doing, and let recipients make outbound web requests instead of listen and respond to filesystem updates. Removes all of the ""script kiddie"" overhead described above, works much more reliably, enables much better error handling, easy to build, and more.</p>

"Putting a whole linux server under source control (git)","<p>I am thinking about putting my whole linux server under version control using git. The reason behind it being that that might be the easiest way to detect malicious modifications/rootkits. All I would naively think is necessary to check the integrity of the system: Mount the linux partition every week or so using a rescue system, check if the git repository is still untempered and then issue a git status to detect any changes made to the system.</p>

<p>Apart from the obvious waste in disk space, are there any other negative side-effects?</p>

<p>Is it a totally crazy idea?</p>

<p>Is it even a secure way to check against rootkits since I most likely would have to at least exclude /dev and /proc ?</p>

"Automatically check for Security Updates on CentOS or Scientific Linux?","<p>We have machines running RedHat-based distros such as CentOS or Scientific Linux. We want the systems to automatically notify us if there are any known vulnerabilities to the installed packages. FreeBSD does this with the <a href=""http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en/books/handbook/security-portaudit.html"">ports-mgmt/portaudit</a> port.</p>

<p>RedHat provides <a href=""https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/node/10021"">yum-plugin-security</a>, which can check for vulnerabilities by their Bugzilla ID, <a href=""http://cve.mitre.org/about/"">CVE</a> ID or advisory ID. In addition, Fedora recently started to support <a href=""http://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/Fedora/16/html/System_Administrators_Guide/sec-Plugin_Descriptions.html"">yum-plugin-security</a>. I believe this was added in Fedora 16.</p>

<p>Scientific Linux 6 did not <a href=""http://www.mail-archive.com/scientific-linux-users@listserv.fnal.gov/msg09470.html"">support yum-plugin-security as of late 2011</a>. It does ship with <code>/etc/cron.daily/yum-autoupdate</code>, which updates RPMs daily. I don't think this handles Security Updates only, however.</p>

<p>CentOS does <a href=""http://bugs.centos.org/view.php?id=3578"">not support yum-plugin-security</a>.</p>

<p>I monitor the CentOS and Scientific Linux mailinglists for updates, but this is tedious and I want something which can be automated.</p>

<p>For those of us who maintain CentOS and SL systems, are there any tools which can:</p>

<ol>
<li>Automatically (Progamatically, via cron) inform us if there are known vulnerabilities with my current RPMs.</li>
<li>Optionally, automatically install the minimum upgrade required to address a security vulnerability, which would probably be <code>yum update-minimal --security</code> on the commandline?</li>
</ol>

<p>I have considered using yum-plugin-changelog to print out the changelog for each package, and then parse the output for certain strings. Are there any tools which do this already?</p>

"Security plan for business critical information and service accessibility","<p>I'm involved in creating a web based business solution. The idea is that the customers will use it, get their business processes and information into one place and also receive added business value by inter-system communication. In short they will use it as a core tool in their daily work and will depend highly upon it.</p>

<p>One problem in need of a solution is how to get this web system secure enough to be an alternative which both we and the customers will find satisfactory. I am looking for good advice from others who have been or are in the same situation.</p>

<p>In our specific scenario we're currently looking at using Java SE 6, Tomcat (as a Servlet container, needed as we will use Wicket), Hibernate (to interact with our database) and MySQL (as DBMS).</p>

<p>I think the problem and advice will be of interest for other technology users as well. As many of the issues are general ones regarding HDD failure, network accessibility and other things.</p>

<p>Feel free to give any advice you have! I still provide some questions and thoughts to get us going:</p>

<ul>
<li>The system needs to be reachable through the Internet. What should we think about when deciding on how to host it? (i.e. do we need our web host to have multiple physical paths connecting them to the Internet and similar questions.)</li>
<li>Are there check lists for these kinds of things? Maybe ISO standards or some other way of seeing that we are on the right track by looking through an article/check list/academic paper/book?</li>
<li>Later in the project we think it would be a good idea to get someone involved who has extensive experience in the field. In that case we're not looking for a normal web developer. It is likely that more consulting firms will tell us they are capable of providing this expertise then there actually are. Any tips on how we will get in contact with the right people? (We're based in Scandinavia, so it would be preferable to find someone there.)</li>
<li>How high up time is good enough? 99.99% seems like a reasonable goal. But any downtime might result in loss of business for our customers.</li>
<li>How do we guarantee that each customer only will be able to access its own data? As the system will be able to access it's own database, it seems hard. A proper development process, involving lots of testing, is really all we have regarding user privileges.</li>
<li>How do we deal with HDD failures? Is RAID 5 in combination with a daily incremental backup and a weekly full backup enough? Or would you go for RAID 6?</li>
<li>If one server is enough to serve the clients. Would you still use a cluster? (I would think so.) And in that case, how many nodes would you have in the cluster?</li>
<li>Which backup strategy would you use?</li>
<li>Do you think hosting the system in a computer cloud is a good alternative? (i.e. as provided by Amazon, Google or others.)</li>
<li>Would you use hard disk encryption? And if so, which kind? (One clarification: Yes it's only good if someone steals the hard disk, but that's still added security and may prevent (physical) intruders access to vital client business data.)</li>
<li>Is providing the customer with a way to do their own backups as well a good alternative? These customers won't be technically oriented. So in that case downloading the information in a ZIP archive containing Microsoft Office files might be a good way?</li>
<li>How would you monitor the solution?</li>
<li>Which of these things do you think we should do in house and which should be out sourced? We will develop the core system our self's, of course.</li>
<li>If you feel that the system is secure, as a technical person. How do you convince a non technical person that it's safe and secure?</li>
</ul>

<p>Thank you for your time! I hope you have some input to share. More questions might be added later.</p>

"How can I block Firefox from allowing me to create new profiles?","<p>I'm very easily distracted so I use <a href=""https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/leechblock/"" rel=""nofollow"">Leechblock</a> with Firefox to help me focus while I'm at work.  This works great (especially because I have it set to require a 64-character password in order to make any changes to the settings).  I have one profile for ""personal"" stuff where only a few sites (e.g. Pandora) are always allowed and everything else is only unblocked for a few minutes each hour (I give myself those few minutes each hour to take a break, check facebook or personal email, etc.).  In the ""work"" profile, all distracting sites are blocked.  I'm pretty good about actively blocking new sites that I get to that are not work-related.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I've now grown accustomed to just creating a new Firefox profile whenever I want to go to a page that's blocked in both profiles.  It's too easy to start with the profile manager, and when Firefox starts with the new profile, of course there are no extensions so every site is available.</p>

<p>Is there any way to remove the ability to add a new profile or start the profile manager (or at least make it reasonably difficult to do so)?</p>

"Client App Verification","<p>Im developing a Rails app that will contain a web front end as well as expose a service to a client app. This client app (for now being written in .Net) will just be sending data (not sensitive data, just statistics) to the service. Although this data will be tied to a user account on the site so they can view results online.</p>

<p>My question pertains to the best way to verify the user that downloaded the app to the website. I'm thinking of different ways to do it and here's what I've come up with:</p>

<p>-Have the user provide their login information (username/password) in the app and send that along with te data (most likely encrypted).
-When someone registers for an account, generate a key specifically for the client app and have them provide that when installing the app.</p>

"Facebook integration - Do you need a separate page to interact with a custom object or are multiple objects on a page possible?","<p>I am working with Facebook integration for the first time.</p>

<p>It seems from the docs that custom objects must have a separate page for each object, since you have to include that object's meta tags in the head of a page.</p>

<p>Does that mean that I cant have multiple custom objects on a single page?  </p>

<p>Can I somehow have multiple custom objects listed on a single page and be able to interact with them through custom actions?</p>

<p>Using the example that the docs work with .. would it be possible to have 20 recipies on a single page and have the user say ""I am cooking recipe A, B, and C"", and have each selection trigger a post to his wall?</p>

<p>I was hoping to simply attach object IDs to my items on a page, and pass them using AJAX to trigger actions.. but then I read about the meta-tags, and I cant think of how I could do this now.  It seems you have to send the user to a discreet page for each item.  Is this true?</p>

"Cannot list tabs in a page using the page access token","<p>I am trying to list all the tabs of a page using the Graph Api Explorer. I am using a token generated by a page administrator. With that token I go to 128274006712/tabs and I can see a list of tabs for that application.</p>

<p>But when I obtain a page token, 128274006712?fields=access_token, and use that token to access the list of tabs, it just returns this:</p>

<pre><code>{
  ""data"": [
  ]
}
</code></pre>

<p>I could successfully delete a tab from that page using the same access token, so it clearly has at least delete permissions. And I could successfully add a tab to the page using another page access token obtained using the original user token.</p>

<p>Is this a bug, or am I missing something here?</p>

"Advice on using Wordpress or a PHP Framework?","<p>I am currently building a blog type website for myself. I have used wordpress in the past and really enjoy it, but when it comes to building more than just a blog I usually get bogged down in writing hacks for it.</p>

<p>The site I'm building is going to pretty much be a blog, but with a 'question and answer' side to it (NOT A FORUM - purely Q&amp;A). Therefore, bbPress and buddyPress doesn't quite hit the mark. I have used CI for awhile now, but when it comes to security I fall short. CI does not have an auth library, however, Kohana does.</p>

<p>My question is: I would like to have full control over my site, but I'm worried about my lack of knowledge in the security department. Would I be better off using Wordpress as a base, or would it be beneficial for me in the long run to use something like Kohana?</p>

<p>In the StumbleUpon toolbar for Firefox there is a ""<strong>92</strong>"" text displayed in the above pic; these are basically sites sent to me by my StumbleUpon friends. Whenever I have sites from my friends, that will be in the toolbar and when I click the <strong>Stumble</strong> button it shows those sites to me instead of any new sites.</p>

<p>You can say these links are like new mails, so there are 92 new mails for me, but I don't want to check them - I just want to mark them as read in a single click, and move further to read other old mails.</p>

<p>Is there any option to mark these sites (sent to me by my StumbleUpon friends) as read, so that when I click the Stumble button, new sites will be shown instead of sites sent to me by my friends?</p>

"Facebook Like button not displaying Open Graph results in comment box on first click only","<p><strong>(The site page used for this example is at this location: www.businessreviewcanada.ca/marketing/social-media/market-pose-of-tranquility. Sorry about that! I'm a new user and am only allowed 2 hyperlinks [following] for now! This is an edited question that I originally intro'd on the main stackoverflow thread, and deemed it better to be directed specifically at the Facebook section with the fresh edit, so I've lobbied to close the original thread, and here we are.)</strong></p>

<p>I have recently deployed the XFBML version of the Facebook Like button on an existing site and am experiencing an issue where the first time the Like button is clicked, the comment box appears, but is otherwise blank, seeming to not draw any info from the Open Graph elements in place in order to be able to display the accompanying article title, image thumbnail, and entry excerpt. The image at the following link shows what appears the first time the Like button is clicked for a particular article:</p>

<p><a href=""http://s90778212.onlinehome.us/personal/images/likescreen1.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">Comment box with no info</a></p>

<p>Even though there's no accompanying Open Graph element info, I can still ""Post to Facebook"" with or without a comment, and the article has been automatically liked with the button click (as expected). However, if I go Unlike/Delete the article mention on my Facebook wall and return to the site article to try again (refreshing the page in order to reset the Like count to 0 - on this second attempt, all the required information populates the area underneath the comment section as it should have the first time, as seen in the following linked image:</p>

<p><a href=""http://s90778212.onlinehome.us/personal/images/likescreen2.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">Comment box with info included</a></p>

<p><strong>(Likewise, even though the Facebook Like count number was still ""0"" on this article when I posted this question, if any of you now try clicking the Like button on that article, the comment box will populate as it should on this one since I've already gone through the Like-Share/Unlike-Delete process on it myself, so this is now not the article to test to see the problem in action. Thus the screen image jpg's to display what happens, so you don't have to go search for an article with a ""0"" count that hasn't been ""initialized"" per se.)</strong></p>

<p>Even though this implementation is a new deployment, there was previously both prior-generation Facebook Like and Facebook Share buttons existing on these article pages, and because the Facebook process is apparently smart enough to know the previous like/share history of an existing article, some articles already have count numbers, and those articles don't exhibit this initialization issue. Only brand-new articles with a zero count, or existing articles that have never been ""liked"" before. There is still a separate and different Facebook Like plugin installed for other types of ""video"" article pages, and that plugin generates the Open Graph elements needed for all Facebook Like (and Google+ for that matter) deployments on these pages (and is the source of the Open Graph elements that you can see in the source code of that example link). I discovered that process when OG elements were being duplicated in results, thanks to me creating a separate OG meta set for this new vertical count button. And likewise, maybe this is the source of the conflict. It seems odd that it only occurs on first click, like some sort of initialization process is not occurring properly.</p>

<p>Hopefully this edit helps clarify the original question. I've done a pretty thorough search and can't find much about people experiencing the same or similar situation, so I'm assuming there's something problematic with just this deployment. But to answer the original questions: 1) Yes, I have used the Facebook Linter, and no errors are reported. 2) All pages are publicly accessible. </p>

<p>Irritatingly, it doesn't even show logs anymore since jetpack and firebug have been updated in the meantime :p<br />
I'd expect this code to replace the title of stackoverflow.com pages with ""Foo"" - but this is just an example, replace stackoverflow.com with anything else if that might help, i.e. probably a site with less javascript magic than SO.com.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong><br />
I solved the problem with the help of the answer below.<br />
The working example looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>function replaceTitle() 
{
  var doc=this.contentDocument;
  console.log(""replaceTitle ""+ doc);
  if(doc)
  {
    var location = doc.location;

    if ( (location.protocol == ""http:"" || location.protocol == ""https:"")
      &amp;&amp; location.host.indexOf(""stackoverflow.com"") !== -1 )
    {
      doc.title = ""Foo"";
      console.log(""Title set to ""+doc.title);
    }      
    else
    {
      console.log(""Location ""+location);
    }
  }
}


var state = ""on"";

function toggleState()
{
  if( state == ""off"" )
  {
    state = ""on"";
    jetpack.tabs.onReady(replaceTitle);
  }
  else
  {
    state = ""off"";
    jetpack.tabs.onReady.unbind(replaceTitle);
  }
  console.log(state);
}

jetpack.statusBar.append(
{
  html: ""Boo"",
  onReady: function(widget) 
    {
      console.log(""ready: ""+state);
      $(widget).click(toggleState);
    },
  onUnload: function(widget) 
    {
      console.log(""unload"");
    },

"Collect outlook email responses as tasks and populate in excel spreadsheet","<p>would appreciate any help / suggestions </p>

<p>I'm very new to VBA &amp; macros. I work in administration and I have a lot of interrelated tasks and I would like to speed up the process a bit. </p>

<p>I receive an approval email from managers telling me which items a new employee will need / is approved for when they start. I then need to create a task/reminder for each item I need to remember to organise for this employee and transfer all of the responses across to a tracking spreadsheet on a shared drive so that we can track the applications / items for the new employee.    </p>

<p>What would be great is if I could set up a rule so that automatically when I receive one of these emails a task is created for each individual item with a ""yes"" and ignored for ""no"" and all the ""yes / no "" responses are populated into the next available single row in the excel sheet. Even better would be if when I mark the task in outlook as ""completed"" it transferred this info to the excel sheet - this might be wishful thinking. </p>

<p>For example the email might look like this:</p>

<pre><code>Employee Name: John Doe
Line Manager: Jane Smith
Start Date: 1/1/2012 
Item 1: Yes
Item 2: No
Item 3: Yes
Item 4: Yes
</code></pre>

<p>And the excel would have a column for each of the above. </p>

<p>Last night internet explorer froze once too, but it has not happened since. Disabling shock-wave does not have any affect on the problem. Because it is happening across multiple browsers, I do not believe it to be caused by any extensions I have installed on Chrome.

<p>I have 3000 rows and my macro must copy all the contents from, 1500 to 2500 rows to other sheet, The condition is, I have set an autofilter to the sheet, Now some cells are invisible, so the sheet shows us only filtered rows,So some of the rows from 1500 to 2500 are invisble due to autofilter mode. and now my macro must copy all the contents from, 1500 to 2500 rows, even though if the rows are invisible due to auotfilter.</p>

<p>I just did normal copy paste operation on the filtered sheet and it copied all the rows from 1500 to 2500  which are invisible also, is that how it works ? copy , paste operation copies all the cells even though when filters  are set ? I just wanted to make sure because yesterday, it copied only filtered rows and today , it copied all the rows, so im just bit confused</p>

"Best Practices to handle multiple open workbooks in an Excel VSTO add-in","<p>I'm working on an Excel VSTO add-in in VB.Net.  I am trying to address the question of knowing which workbook my add-in should be effecting given that a user may open or close many workbooks before, after, or during use of my main form.</p>

<p>The main functions all center around editing a main template file, which the user presumably the saves with useful names, and might come back to for reference or further editing.  The add-in opens a form and performs various functions like adding information from a database to a worksheet, or adding sheets to a workbook (and lots of stats).  Much of what I'm doing relies on calling a particular workbook:</p>

<pre><code>        CurrentRun = Marshal.GetActiveObject(""Excel.Application"")
        CurrentBook = CurrentRun.Workbooks(CurrentIndex)
</code></pre>

<p>Where <code>CurrentIndex</code> is the index from a combobox which is populated/updated with names of the currently open workbooks:</p>

<pre><code>    ...
    ControlCurrentWBComboBox.Items.Clear()
    CurrentRun = Marshal.GetActiveObject(""Excel.Application"")
    For n = 1 To CurrentRun.Workbooks.Count()
        ControlCurrentWBComboBox.Items.Add(CurrentRun.Workbooks(n).Name)
    Next
    CurrentRun = Nothing
    ...
</code></pre>

<p>This requires the user to select the workbook (by name) that they want to be working with.  This seemed like a good idea until I put it in front of 8 different users today.  Most eventually got used to having select the workbook, but not without a lot of grumbling and throwing errors (which were well handled).  2 users never got it, and were continually accidentally editing the wrong workbook, and throwing errors an hour into use.</p>

<p>Is there a better way to handle this?  I'm thinking of trying to make two versions: one with the above and one for people who need fewer options.  Is there a way to force a sort of 1-to-1 relationship you can get by putting VBA code in the workbook itself?</p>

<p>Am I way of base by even trying to deal with this or referencing anything other than ActiveWorkbook?</p>

<p>[Note: I'm a little scared by the blue warning that's telling me this is a subjective question.  I'm not meaning for it to be; perhaps I need help with the wording?]</p>

"Rails: Method to integrate Facebook in future versions","<p>I am working on a Rails-version of a website where I have already created a login-structure using <strong>authlogic</strong> as login. The reason for chosing it is that I have used it for my other three Rails-websites, but why I started with it I can't remember.</p>

<p>My web application would be way better off with a Facebook-login and other types of integrations with Facebook but it is not crucial for the MVP. In order to have a quicker launch and push the whole learning-and-implementing effort to the future I am considering to push this Facebook-integration to 2.0. I am still but of a novice and it all seems quite complicated.</p>

<p>My major issue with this, however, is that I don't want to end up in a situation where I can't combine the two in the future. I am afraid this will mean that I will have to have two parallell set of users.</p>

<p>Today I am using a User-table with information like: user_name, id (i.e. the Rails row id), full name, birth date etc. I would like, in the future, the user to be able to login using Facebook instead and tie it to his old account. I am using the user.id as the connection between all the other tables in the application (comments, questions asked, ideas etc).</p>

<p>A. Would integration with Facebook be possible the way I am planning to do or am I creating an even larger problem for the future doing it like this?</p>

<p>B. Should I refrain from using <em>authlogic</em> here (and in general as well perhaps)? Using <em>omniauth</em> or <em>devise</em> (as I have been recommended) would take some time and effort and I already have a working login system, but if it is a strong recommendation, I will change.</p>

"Spring Security grails plugin fails when deployed as war tomcat 6","<p>I've seen a similar question asked with the exact same error as I have, however the context was different. I am not having problems with testing, rather, user and role creation fail completely on launch.</p>

<p>When using the spring-security-core 1.2.7 plugin with grails 1.3.7 and tomcat 6, I get this failure:</p>

<p>2012-01-04 16:23:12,476 [main] ERROR context.ContextLoader  - Context initialization failed

    at org.codehaus.groovy.grails.web.context.GrailsContextLoader.createWebApplicationContext(GrailsContextLoader.java:87)
...</p>

<p>The app runs fine when launched with grails runApp, but upon war'ing, it fails to deploy every time. The error seems to center around my user account/role creation in the bootstrap:</p>

<pre><code>def adminRole = new Role(authority: 'ROLE_ADMIN').save(flush: true)
def userRole = new Role(authority: 'ROLE_USER').save(flush: true)
def testUser = new User(username: 'me', enabled: true, password: 'password')
testUser.save(flush: true)
UserRole.create testUser, adminRole, true
</code></pre>

<p>This is taken from the springSecurity tutorial directly. Any suggestions?</p>

<p>Edit: Additionally, this also fails with grails prod run-war and it is directly related to role/user creation. Even with different names for users and roles, the problem persists.</p>

<p>Edit 2: Also, the failure is on the .save(), which of course the original error message showed. I verified that a regular .save() vs a save(flush: true) makes no difference.</p>

<p>Edit 3: It seems it might be a bug in the current version of plugin: <a href=""http://jira.grails.org/browse/GPSPRINGSECURITYCORE-152"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jira.grails.org/browse/GPSPRINGSECURITYCORE-152</a>

<p>I wanted to set up a database on the web server, and modify the PHP store scripts to store the sales into the database. Then the client would log into an SSL extranet portal with a browser, and see the sales securely -- fed from the database on the same webserver.</p>

<p>But the client said he didn't want this because he doesn't want customer data on the web server -- even though not credit card information is stored -- just names, e-mail addresses, and items purchased, and such. He prefers to have that data stored on a server at his office, which is only connected to the intranet, and has no outside access.</p>

<p>The intranet server which currently stores the data cannot be accessed from outside, and so cannot be accessed from the web server which processes sales, of course.</p>

<p>Is it the norm to have sales data on the web server? How do SaaS companies do this? Is their subscription customer data on the web server in a database?</p>

<p>If the client's request is viable, what's the standard accepted approach of having sales be automatically processed, and not just e-mailed, but to have those sales wind up on the intranet machine rather than on the web server? Would the intranet machine have to log into the web server and ""grab"" the sales from a temporary table on the web server? Would the web server have a custom service running just to service the connection from the intranet server and feed it recent sales, and then remove those sale records from the web server?</p>

<p>Basically, what's the standard way of moving sale data from a public web server machine to an intranet machine? Or am I not approaching this issue in the right way? </p>

"How to test if a fluent service method is called","<p>I have a security rule that a newly registered user has full permissions over their own user entity.

<pre><code>public User Register(UserRegisterTask userRegistrationTask) {
   User user = User.Create(userRegistrationTask);
   this.userRepository.Save(user);

   // Give this user permission to do operations on itself

"improving database performance for a facebook style walling page","<p>This is about a social networking site. Let Facebook be our model.</p>

<p>there is a table in mysql server: 'posts' to keep precords of all the posts (excluding comments for simplicity). Its columns are:</p>

<p>id, post, user_id, frnd_id_1, frnd_id_2.</p>

<p>id: primary key , auto-incrementing.</p>

<p>post : post written on the wall (be it the wall of the logged in user or the one of any of his/her friends)</p>

<p>user_id: id of the logged in user (suppose A)</p>

<p>friend_id_1: friend (suppose B) of the logged-in user . this field is used when A writes on B's wall.</p>

<p>friend_id_2: friend (suppose C) of the friend of the logged-in user </p>

<p>if there is any message correspondence between A and B that is recorded in the mysql table acccordingly. </p>

<p>Suppose B writes something on C's wall then on the friends of B will see it in their individual wall. Suppose B has 100 friends. We could keep record of it in the said table in this manner: frnd_id_2 will be used to keep the recordof C's id;</p>

<p>If frind_2 has a '0' record , the message correspondence isonly between user_id and frnd_id_1, else it will mean frnd_id_1 has written on the wall of frnd_id_2 and frind_id_1 is a friend of user_id. </p>

<p>UP TO THIS , I THINK, EVERYTHING IS EXACTLY SIMILAR WITH FACEBOOK.</p>

<p>But -</p>

<p>Suppose B has 100 friends. In that case if B writes on C's wall (assume that all the privacy settings r open for friends of friends). If the aforementioned policy is taken, there will be 101 records in the table  :</p>

<p>1) One record just to mean that B has posted on C's wall (frnd_id_2=0) .(Let us call it the MAIN RECORD)</p>

<p>2) Another 100 records for the 100 friends of B. (frnd_id_2!=0)</p>

<p>This is the way I have in my brain. I could improve it a bit more by inserting into the 'post' column (or keeping 'post' column blank and creating another one namely 'main_record_id')not the full message, but the id of the main record.</p>

<p>But the thing is: For a single post, 101 db queries(in this case) need to be executed. Any other way to improve db performance?</p>

"Like Box Social Plugin iframe doesn't scroll in an UIWebView","<p>I loaded the <a href=""https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/plugins/like-box/"" rel=""nofollow"">Like Box <code>iframe</code> code generated on Facebook</a> into an <code>UIWebView</code> on my iPhone App. It works well, but when I scroll, it scrolls the <code>UIWebView</code> itself, and not the content inside the <code>iframe</code>. How can I block the <code>UIWebView</code> from scrolling (i.e the <code>UIWebView</code> takes the fullscreen frame) and allow the overflowed content of the <code>iframe</code> to scroll instead ?</p>

"Updating DOM via Javascript causing memory leaks (only in Firefox?)","<p>I know this question has been asked before, but none of the answers seem to resolve the issue. I'm testing an AJAX webpage which updates elements in the DOM via javascript.  </p>

<p>Every minute, the server is queried for new data and the DOM is updated accordingly. From what I can tell, the memory usage for this page in Chrome grows, but not too much (it starts around 40 MB and reaches maybe 80 MB max).  In Firefox, however, the memory usage starts around 120 MB and can expand to over 400 MB. I've stepped through the Javascript with Firebug and it seems like the memory expands the most when the DOM is updated via my Javascript methods.</p>

<p>The DOM manipulation is simple, such as:</p>

<pre><code>var myTable = document.createElement(""table"");

var thead = document.createElement(""thead"");
var tr = document.createElement(""tr"");
var th = document.createElement(""th"");
th.appendChild(document.createTextNode(""column1""));
tr.appendChild(th);

for(var test in obj.testObjs){
    th = document.createElement(""th"");
    th.appendChild(document.createTextNode(obj.testObjs[test].myVar));
    tr.appendChild(th);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Before appending new data to the nodes in the DOM, I first clear the existing data.  I've tried a number of ways, including what is described here: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3785258/how-to-remove-dom-elements-without-memory-leaks"">How to remove DOM elements without memory leaks?</a></p>

<p>As well as a simple way such as:</p>

<pre><code>function clearChildren(node){
    if(node != null){
        while (node.hasChildNodes()) node.removeChild(node.firstChild);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I've also read ( <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3750797/cyclic-adding-removing-of-dom-nodes-causes-memory-leaks-in-javascript"">Cyclic adding/removing of DOM nodes causes memory leaks in JavaScript?</a> ) that browsers only start collecting garbage when it reaches a certain level? Can that be confirmed? I feel that my PC is running sluggish after a while due to the growing memory.</p>

<p>I feel there has to be a solution to this, because commercial sites I've tested that perform the same functional steps do not cause memory usage to grow.</p>

<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

"What do you do about staff and personal laptops?","<p>Today, one of our developers had his laptop stolen from his house.  Apparently, he had a full svn checkout of the company's source code, as well as a full copy of the SQL database.</p>

<p>This is one massive reason why I'm personally against allowing company work on personal laptops.<br>
However, even if this had been a company owned laptop, we'd still have the same problem, although we would be in a slightly stronger position to enforce encryption (WDE) on the whole disk.  </p>

<p>Questions are these:</p>

<ol>
<li>What does your company do about company data on non company owned hardware?</li>
<li>Is WDE a sensible solution? Does it produce a lot of overhead on reads/writes?</li>
<li>Other than changing passwords for things that were stored/accessed from there, is there anything else you can suggest?</li>

"Testing for the existance of constants within a range object in Excel VBA","<p>I am using the SpecialCells method of the Excel Range object on a given target range with the type set to xlCellTypeConstants.
Of course if the range I'm checking does not contain any constants, I get the run time error 1004.</p>

<p>I can solve this by trapping that error with an 'on error' statement but i'd like to avoid that when I can.
So I'm looking for some means to check my target range for the existence of constants in one of the cells before applying the SpecialCells(xlCellTypeConstants) method to it.</p>

<p>So we're wondering: what causes Excel to ""choke"" more? Is it raw amounts of data? References to other spreadsheets? References to other workbooks? Formatting/formulas? Any advice as to its weak points would go a long way in helping us to keep the project managable.</p>

"SecurityContextHolder.getContext().getAuthentication().getDetails() on static method idSession cached","<p>Hi everyone I'm using Spring Security 3.1 with my Project  and I have a util class where I have <strong>SecurityContextHolder.getContext().getAuthentication().getDetails()</strong> so I can use it anywhere in my project the problem is that the first time I login everything works alright I can get to my CustomDetail Object and set some general variables.<br>
But if I logout and then try to change this variables in my CustomDetail Object they will not change. Did some debugging and find out that my Util Class was only call the first time its used (that I understand to be the normal behavior on this type of method STATIC),</p>

<p>So the second time I  login and try to use this util Class I get the contex from the previous session. 
but while Im debuggin I make a call to SecurityContexHolder.... I get the actual Context. is like this static property cached the context just the first time....</p>

<p>this is the logout part in  security.xml</p>

<pre><code>&lt;logout invalidate-session=""true"" logout-success-url=""/seguridad/login.html""
logout-url=""/seguridad/logout.html"" delete-cookies=""JSESSIONID"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>this is the code</p>

<pre><code>public static CustomAuthenticationDetails authenticationDetails = getContextDetailsFromUser();
public static CustomAuthenticationDetails getContextDetailsFromUser() {
        Optional&lt;Object&gt; optionalCaD =Optional.of(SecurityContextHolder.getContext().getAuthentication().getDetails());
        optionalCaD.isPresent();
        return (CustomAuthenticationDetails) optionalCaD.get();     
    }

public static Access getPerfilAcceso() {
    return authenticationDetails.getPerfilAcceso();
}

public static void setPerfilAcceso(Access perfilAcceso) {
    authenticationDetails.setPerfilAcceso(perfilAcceso);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now what I did was to suppress guavas Optional objects and just return  SecurityContextHolder like so</p>

<pre><code>public static CustomAuthenticationDetails getContextDetailsFromUser() {
    return (CustomAuthenticationDetails) SecurityContextHolder.getContext().getAuthentication().getDetails();
}
</code></pre>

<p>and make the call  using the method instead of the static property authenticationDetails</p>

<pre><code>   public static String getVerModel() {
    return getContextDetailsFromUser().getVerModel();
}
</code></pre>

<p>so now I'm able to access/change my  <strong>CURRENT</strong> custom detail Object and not the last one/ last session before I login. But now  I get a request to the static method  all the time. </p>

<p>Questions:</p>

<p>-Is this the normal flow in the static method?</p>

<p>-How can I implement a centralized Class where I can store the SecurityContextHolder.... and not worrying about storing the context from past sessions?</p>

<p>thank You for your time </p>

I can visit Google in all other browsers and they do not have this problem.  Anything within the google.com domain fails to load.  I haven't found a clear bug by Mozilla team for this, but something seems incredibly wrong here.  I only have the problem with the google.com domain.  I haven't changed anything in about:config.  The only plugin I use if Firebug and disabling it does not help.  My last option here seems to be re-installing or possibly creating a new profile, unless someone has a suggestion.  Google will sometimes come back without clearing out everything only to fail again later.  The only for sure way to get Google to come back is clearing all cache and cookies.  I think we can pretty much rule out network problems here due to the fact Google will load in all other browsers.</p>

"bad request/method not implemented error when publishing actions to the timeline","<p>I am working on a Joomla site and using myApi to handle most facebook integrations. The like button is working fine and picking up information from the og meta tags inserted by myApi.</p>

<p>On the website, the user can login using facebook - I have added the publish_actions permission to the myApi code, and I know this is being requested because when authorising the app, the oauth dialog says that actions like ordering from restaurants (the action i added to my fb app) will be posted to the timeline.</p>

<p>now, while ordering, I check whether the user has an entry in the myApi user table and if so, I provide a checkbox that lets the customer choose whether she wants the order action posted to her timeline. if ticked, I then use curl to try and post the order action to facebook. I have been using my account to test - I have authorised the app with all permissions requested. I use the myApi interface to get my user access token. I am adding the access_token and object url to the url as querystring parameters and then posting to it through curl.</p>

<p>The curl response I get is:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;
&lt;TITLE&gt;400 Bad Request&lt;/TITLE&gt;

"Beginner to VBA: Greater than","<p>I have numerical values entered in Row 1 from columns <code>A</code> to <code>IA</code>.  I want to create a loop that compares one cell with the cell before it (aka Cell <code>B1</code> to <code>A1</code> or cell <code>F</code> to <code>E</code>). Let's use <code>B1</code> and <code>A1</code> as the example. It looks at the Value in Cell <code>B1</code> and sees if it is greater then the value of the cell in <code>A1</code>. If it is greater then I want a <code>+</code> to be entered in the Cell <code>B2</code>.  Also if <code>B1</code> is <code>&lt; A1</code> put a <code>-</code> into Cell <code>B2</code>. I want the program to be able to loop this process so it does it for all the columns <code>A-AI</code>. Below is what I want want the program to do (not including the dashes and teh paranthesis around the positive and negative signs of course).</p>

<pre>
        A        B        C        D        F
1       33.12    34.52    34.92    35.19    34.97
2                (+)      (+)      (+)      (-)
</pre>

<p>I realize this task is easily performed in excel (not using VBA) but I am trying to learn VBA so I can perform much more complex tasks. I have written the basic code to do the simple task but I am not sure how to loop it so it will do this for all my cells!</p>

<pre><code>Sub EnterFormula()

    Dim x As Integer
    Dim y As Integer

    x = Worksheets(""Sheet2"").Range(""C2"").Value
    y = Worksheets(""Sheet2"").Range(""B2"").Value

    If x &gt; y Then
        Worksheets(""Sheet2"").Range(""C4"") = ""+""
    End If

End Sub
</code></pre>

<p>Ok So for the next part of My Program. It gets a touch more complicated. We move onto row 3. Row 3 is going to either have a U (for Up) or a D (for down) or nothing. </p>

<p>Let's Start at Column C. Column C1 has a value of 34.92, and C2 was given a + (as 34.92 was larger then the day before which was 33.02).  Now we go to the first previous ""+"" WITH AT LEAST one opposite sign (in this case ""-"") in between. So in this case that is row A (one ""-"" inbetween under row B).  Now if the Numerical Value in C1 (34.92) is larger then the numerical value in A (33.12) then we designate a ""U"" in C3. If it was NOT larger we would leave an empty cell in C3.  </p>

<p>Let's move onto column D. Column D1 has a value of 35.19 which is greater then the C1 value of 34.92 and this is why D2 has a ""+"". Next we go to the first previous ""+"" WITH AT LEAST one opposite sign (in this case ""-"") in between. So in this case that is row A again. Since the numerical value in D1 (39.19) is greater then the numerical value in A1 (33.12) then D3 gets a U.  </p>

<p>Moving onto Column F (32.97)...Note:I changed the value a little from the original F. 32.97 is LESS then 35.19 (D1) which is why F2 is a ""-"". Next we go to the first previous ""-"" WITH AT LEAST one opposite sign (in this case ""+"") in between. So in this case this is Row B (with two ""+"" signs in between). Now because we are dealing with ""-"" signs this time we look and see if the numerical value in F1 is LESS then the numerical value in B1...which it is, so a ""D"" is entered in F3. If F1 was larger then B1 then the cell would be left empty.</p>

<p>Onto Column G (35.21). This is greater then 32.97 (F1) and therefore gets a ""+"" in G2.  Next we go to the first previous ""+"" WITH AT LEAST one opposite sign in between (in this case ""-""). So in this case this is Row D (with one ""-"" in between). Since the numerical value of G1 is greater then that of D1 we designate a ""U"". If it was not greater we would leave the cell empty.  </p>

<pre>
        A        B        C        D        F        G        H        I

2       (+)      (-)      (+)      (+)      (-)      (+)      (+)      (+)

"Windows Firewall - simple way to block an IP address that is scanning? User keeps getting locked","<p>I am using Windows Server 2008 - fully patched.  </p>

<p>One of my user accounts keeps getting locked.  It is easy enough to unlock it - but it is happening with increasing frequency - and the user is not entering incorrect passwords.</p>

<p>I checked the security log - and see attempts to scan from a specific IP address.  I would like to block all activity from this IP address.  Is this easy to do?  I don't have physical access to the server - so I am hesitant to experiment with setting up a rule that may accidentally block my access.</p>

<p>Also hoping that I can track down specific activity that is causing this user to get locked.  Isn't there an event that I can look for when the account gets locked?  I don't see it - and this scan that I mentioned above may not be related to the locking - as these 'failed logins' are not for the same user as the user that got locked.  We have been watching the logs as the lock happens - but no clues there yet.</p>

"URL Rewriting and Facebook link information retrieval","<p>I am developing a website and I want to integrate it with Facebook, allowing users to share the pages of my website in their FB walls. My problem is explained in the following lines and my question is at the end.</p>

<p>I am using the following URL rewriting rule in my <code>.htaccess</code> file:</p>

<pre><code>RewriteRule ^([a-zA-Z0-9_-]+)\/?([a-zA-Z0-9_-]+)\/?$ index.php?p1=$1&amp;p2=$2
</code></pre>

<p>That means it will rewrite anything like: <a href=""http://address/parameter1/parameter2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://address/parameter1/parameter2</a> as <a href=""http://address/index.php?p1=parameter1&amp;p2=parameter2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://address/index.php?p1=parameter1&amp;p2=parameter2</a>.</p>

<p>When I post <a href=""http://address/parameter1/parameter2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://address/parameter1/parameter2</a> on FB, it will only show the rewritten URL under that URL.</p>

<p>I posted <a href=""http://address/index.php?p1=parameter1&amp;p2=parameter2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://address/index.php?p1=parameter1&amp;p2=parameter2</a> on FB, and it will show the information I want it to show, the ones I have put in the meta tags.</p>

<p>I tried debugging <a href=""http://address/parameter1/parameter2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://address/parameter1/parameter2</a> on the FB debugger (http://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug), I will get the error:
""The page at ... could not be reached because the server returned status code 400.""</p>

<p>Is there any way I can correct that? That is, actually making the dynamic link behave like a static link, and making that transparent to anyone who links it?</p>

<hr>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>This change in the rewrite rule should solve the problem:
RewriteRule ^([a-z0-9_-]+)/?([a-z0-9_-]+)/?$ index.php?p1$1&amp;p2=$2 [L,NC]</p>

<p>I also changed the redirects in PHP that I was doing.</p>

"Should a script tag's src attribute be null or the empty string if missing?","<p>I'm using <a href=""http://www.princexml.com"" rel=""nofollow"">PrinceXML</a> to make some PDFs of some HTML which includes some <a href=""http://www.mathjax.org"" rel=""nofollow"">MathJax</a> markup. In order to render the math properly, the javascript handling the math rendering needs to be run on the page before conversion to PDF. </p>

<p>If I enable javascript in PrinceXML and try to load the MathJax library, I get a ""TypeError: null value is not an object"" in the initialisation code. Tracking this down, it turns out that the following causes the error:</p>

<pre><code>var scripts = (document.documentElement || document).getElementsByTagName(""script"");
var namePattern = new RegExp(""(^|/)""+BASENAME+""\\.js(\\?.*)?$"");
for (var i = scripts.length-1; i &gt;= 0; i--) {
if (scripts[i].src.match(namePattern)) { // &lt;--- Error thrown here
  STARTUP.script = scripts[i].innerHTML;
  if (RegExp.$2) {
    &lt;etc...&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The error is thrown on a script element without an src attribute (MathJax uses script elements to store LaTeX code in). PrinceXML appears to handle missing src attributes by returning null when accessing a missing src attribute - hence <code>scripts[i].src.match(namePattern)</code> throws an error as <code>src</code> is null. However, when done in Firefox (see fiddle: <a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/9ZHMR/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jsfiddle.net/9ZHMR/</a>) element.src returns the empty string when the src attribute is missing, and so I didn't see this issue when working in the browser.</p>

<p>Which behaviour is 'correct' - should a script element's src attribute be null or the empty string if the attribute does not exist? Is this a case of real-life vs the standards?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong> I'm interested primarily in whether this behavior is specified by a standard somewhere, so I know whether to post a bug report to Firefox or PrinceXML, or if there is no standard, post a bug report to MathJax to handle this case.</p>

Upon googling that, the internet says that its because it can't locate the file i'm referencing.  When I move mysql_connect.php into a folder below root, everything works fine.  The issue is because it is moved outside of the web root (i think).    </p>

The only step-by-step tutorials I can find just tell you to put the config.php file into the same folder which is not secure.  </p>

"Is checking for double dots enough to prevent paths from escaping jail?","<p>I'm writing a service that sends over the network the contents of requested files.  However, I'll only answer requests for files that descend from a fixed <code>parent</code> directory.</p>

<p>The first potential security problem that comes to mind is that an evil user may request paths with <code>..</code> embedded.  Another potential problem are symlinks, though these should not be an issue since I control the local filesystem and there won't be any simlinks under <code>parent</code>.</p>

<p>My question is therefore whether it is enough to check for the existence of <code>..</code> among the path components.  Or is there some other security vulnerability I have forgotten?</p>

"When would I need a SecureString in .NET?","<p>I'm trying to grok the purpose of .NET's SecureString.  From MSDN:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An instance of the System.String class is both immutable and, when no longer needed, cannot be programmatically scheduled for garbage collection; that is, the instance is read-only after it is created and it is not possible to predict when the instance will be deleted from computer memory. Consequently, if a String object contains sensitive information such as a password, credit card number, or personal data, there is a risk the information could be revealed after it is used because your application cannot delete the data from computer memory.</p>
  
  <p>A SecureString object is similar to a String object in that it has a text value. However, the value of a SecureString object is automatically encrypted, can be modified until your application marks it as read-only, and can be deleted from computer memory by either your application or the .NET Framework garbage collector.</p>
  
  <p>The value of an instance of SecureString is automatically encrypted when the instance is initialized or when the value is modified. Your application can render the instance immutable and prevent further modification by invoking the MakeReadOnly method.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is the automatic encryption the big payoff? </p>

<p>And why can't I just say:</p>

<pre><code>SecureString password = new SecureString(""password"");
</code></pre>

<p>instead of</p>

<pre><code>SecureString pass = new SecureString();
foreach (char c in ""password"".ToCharArray())
    pass.AppendChar(c);

"Communicating with users on other web pages","<p>This question is part user experience, part engineering.</p>

<p>I am trying to find a nice, clean way to have a user communicate with my web page while they are on another web page. I have web services that will accept HTTP POST/GET, so AJAX and other asynchronous niceties are welcome - don't worry about the details of their communication, they can easily be modified to fit a solution.</p>

<p>The problem I'm running into lies within the user interaction. Ex., say the user is viewing a web page and they want to send my system the web site's URL. I would like it if they could do it while still looking at that page, and without too many ""crazy clicks"" - currently they have to go back over to my page and enter the information (as you can imagine this has tested horribly).</p>

<p>I have ruled out browser tool bars (easy to do in FF, but a lot of my users use IE) and local applications (they won't want to install Java or Adobe Air apps). </p>

<p>Have you ever solved a problem like this before, or do you have an idea of how I could solve it? Should I be looking at separate solutions for FF and IE (ex., a tool bar for FF and something else for IE)? Don't worry about Safari and Chrome, though a solution that supports them too would be nifty.</p>

"Spring3 Security - SwitchUserFilter - Can we supply encrypted passwords in the implementation of UserDetailsService","<p>Usually the <strong>authentication-provider</strong> of the <strong>authentication-manager</strong> tag is associated with a <strong>user-service-ref</strong> property that points to a bean that implements <strong>UserDetailsService</strong>, but in my application, its <strong>ref</strong> property has been used that points to a bean that implements <strong>AuthenticationProvider</strong>. This bean encodes the password supplied by the user and compares it with the encoded password in the database. 
I have the following configuration in spring-security.xml</p>

<pre><code>&lt;beans:bean id=""myAuthenticationProvider"" class=""com.mysecurity.server.security.MyAuthenticationProvider"" /&gt;

&lt;authentication-manager alias=""authenticationManager""&gt;
    &lt;authentication-provider ref=""eeAuthenticationProvider"" /&gt;
&lt;/authentication-manager&gt;

<pre><code>&lt;beans:bean id=""switchUserProcessingFilter"" class=""org.springframework.security.web.authentication.switchuser.SwitchUserFilter""&gt;
    &lt;beans:property name=""userDetailsService"" ref=""userServices"" /&gt;

&lt;/beans:bean&gt;

<p>The problem is that <strong>UserDetailsService</strong> requires me to supply a password that it would match against the one provided by the user, but I am not storing the original password in the database. There is no option to supply a bean that implements the <strong>AuthenticationProvider</strong> interface (like in the <strong>authentication-provider</strong> property I mentioned above) or an option to tell spring that it needs to encode the password supplied before comparing it with the one I'm providing from the database.

<p>I want to create a lightweight desktop app (let's call it <em>MyApp</em>) (to use Offline) so that users can submit audit findings when they don't have internet connectivity.</p>

<p>Here are the MUST-HAVES:</p>

<ol>
<li>Authenticate the user against my SqlMembershipProvider (anonymous users can't submit audit findings)</li>
<li>Only ask the user for credentials ONCE (when s/he opens <em>MyApp</em>) (I'll have the ability to save the authentication token, but in some cases <em>MyApp</em> will be installed on a laptop that's being used by multiple users, hence I'll have to force users to login every time <em>MyApp</em> is open)</li>
<li>Do NOT store password in plain-text (if user is offline when <em>MyApp</em> is opened, I want to save the credentials to authenticate the user whenever connection is available) - not sure if this is possible</li>
</ol>

<p>Once I get the 3 things above figured out - the rest is easy.</p>

<p>Here's a simple scenario in case the above is confusing:</p>

<ol>
<li><em>MyApp</em> is installed on the office laptop, that people take along when they travel</li>
<li>2 Users travel to remote area (no internet), and conduct 2 separate audits</li>
<li>User 1 opens MyApp, provides his user/pass (see #2 in MUST-HAVES), submits 3 findings (I'll save the findings along with user's credentials to authenticate the user and submit the findings whenever connection becomes available) - see #1 and #3 in MUST-HAVES</li>
<li>User 2 opens MyApp, and does the same routine as User 1 did in step 3.</li>
<li>2 days later they come back to the office, internet is available, findings from steps 3 and 4 are submitted to my web-app on behalf of respective users</li>
</ol>

<p>I've looked into Microsoft Sync framework, but that seemed like an overkill for what I'm doing (and I'm not sure if it can accommodate my MUST-HAVES either).</p>

"How do I gather data from the same column in multiple worksheets in a single workbook?","<p>Okay so here is what I want to accomplish. For this example I have a single workbook composed of 4 data sheets plus a totals sheet. Each of the 4 data sheets has a similar name following the same pattern where the only difference is the date. (Ex. 9854978_1009_US.txt, where 1009 is the date that changes while the rest of the file name is the same). In each of those documents column F contains a series of number that I would like to find the sum of but I will have no idea how many cells in F actually contain numbers. (However there will never be additional information below it the numbers so I could in theory just add the entire F column together). I will also add new files to the workbook over time and do not want to have to rewrite the code of which I gather my data from column F. Essentially what I would like to accomplish is for the 'totals' document to take every column F from documents in the workbook with the name of '9854978_????_US.txt', where the question marks change based on the file name. How would I go about doing this in pure Excel code?</p>

"Spreadsheet multiple formulas mashup","<p>I’m trying to automate some processes for task management, but I’m having no success. I can’t use macros or similar, just formulas, and I’m not an adept at spreadsheet hacking.</p>

<p>Anyways, here’s my workbook, with its <strong>**<em>sheets</em>**</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>**Form**
TASK     LI    DE    X
Test     1     3
Test2    2

**LI**
WEEK     TASK  COMPLETED
1        Test
2        Test
2        Test  *
4        Test2 *

**DE**
WEEK     TASK  COMPLETED
1        Test  *
</code></pre>

<p>What I’ve been trying to do is:</p>

<ul>
<li>On Form, check which column, from LI or DE, is > 0.</li>
<li>For each one > 0, check for the existence of TASK on its respective sheet (LI or DE).</li>
<li>If it is there, check if it has an *.</li>
<li>If it has an *, take the WEEK number of that row, compare it to the WEEK from the other sheet, take the greater number, and load it into the X column of the TASK on Form. The order here doesn’t really matter. I just need the WEEK from the one with an *.</li>
</ul>

<p>For this example, in order for X to change, TASK must be with an * in the sheets where it is. For instance, if, on Form, Test has numbers in LI and DE, and Test has an * in LI sheet, but not in DE sheet, X must remain empty. But if both have it with *, X must be loaded with the greater WEEK between LI and DE.</p>

<p>If I were to do it with macros, I would simply check each column with a loop, but with formulas I suppose nested IFs would suffice.</p>

<p>I’ve tried with VLOOKUP, but it only takes the first item in the array, and though the order doesn’t matter, it is generally (I think I will make this a policy) the last value.</p>

<p>Any doubt, just let me know! I hope I made my issue clear.</p>

"Adding an Extra link in Open Graph Post","<p>We are making an Article Reading app with Open Graph. When ever user reads any article on the App it gets posted as an Activity and his friends can see it.</p>

<p>The problem is if user clicks on the feed title, he is taken to the permission page and he has to grant the permission to read the article. I know that this is the core of Open Graph but we feel it would be great if we can provide a link like ""Read Now"" apart from usual post, which takes the user to the article directly without granting any permission. Obviously, he wont be able to see any friends activity on that page and it wont allow us to post on his behalf, but that is fine because users intention was just to read that particular article.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>Now, Because I have stated '<code>http://foobar.com/page1.html</code>' in my '<strong>recipe</strong>', when this is posted, the open-graph properties are picked from this page.</p>

<p><strong>PROBLEM</strong> : I need to show the link as a thirdparty link www.thirdparty.com/page1.html but the open graph meta properties cannot be written in thirdparty.com/page1.html (as I don't have any control on that page).</p>

<p>So, I decided to do this:</p>

<pre><code>i) Create a dummy page : www.foobar.com/page1.html.
ii) Add all the og meta to it.
iii) Add a redirect (javascript) code to the dummy page so that it goes to the third party page.

<p>My Taxi booking start-up has a website (CakePHP) hosted on EC2 (for reliability) which is a ERP of sorts used only by internal employees. This tool also interacts with the Cabs/Taxis' GPS receivers in that these GPS machines send some data to the public server through some APIs which help decide logic for the Booking process. And as we don't have very strong Net on premises, we've kept it all on EC2.</p>

<p>Now, we are increasingly concerned about leaving information (customer data, vehicle info) like this on the public domain and accessible from the internet and outside the premises by a rogue employee. For our implementation, MySQL replication has already been considered with us reading from a local slave, writing to the master and etc. The only issue being, there's no way non-technical employees would know whether the data is new or whether the replication is broken. Also, we'd prefer our servers online as we don't want to invest in physical security for this hardware.</p>

<p>We are thinking of the following:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>IP address based auth; those belonging to the local NAT would be allowed. Problem is we have a dynamic IP.</p></li>
<li><p>Computername/MacID based auth; almost no-security once the user finds out. Also, can we read these parameters from Chrome?</p></li>
<li><p>Storing a list of IP addresses that login and as there are just 6 employees, we'd be able to monitor it for weird IPs. Not scalable or even secure.</p></li>

When I open the Print Preview dialog box, no preview is displayed.  Attempting to print results in a blank page or no output at all.  (The Print dialog does open, however.)  Attempting to open the Page Setup dialog causes the entire Firefox window to become black, and Firefox cannot be restored without pressing Escape.

"Identify Chat client app in Facebook Chat","<p>I am developing an iOS Facebook Chat client app using XMPP (I am using the XMPPFramework by Robbie Hanson). One of my requirements is my App would want to know if the online users in my roster are using the same App. (So the use case is to provide some extra features when two users are using the same App to communicate).</p>

<p>I am thinking to add my app name in the resource part of the JID (e.g. &lt;...>@chat.facebook.com/myApp) such that my App can use it to identify itself by examining the JIDs of the online users. However, I can't find any way to do it when I look at the JIDs received, they are just &lt;...>@chat.facebook.com.</p>

<p>So does anyone know if it's possible to set the resource for Facebook Chat or if there is another way to achieve what I want?</p>

"Facebook Single Sign On - Dealing with invalid fbs_token cookies","<p>I have an app that successfully uses Facebook's single sign on to log a user in. Once a user is logged in I use the cookie that the Facebook javascript creates to get at the access_token which I of course use for subsequent requests.</p>

<p>I am having an issue though when the user separately visits facebook.com and logs out on their side, then comes back to my site. My application sees the fbs_* cookie still exists and assumes they are logged in to Facebook still. The functionality of my site is, if that cookie exists, to make a graph call to pull some additional information from their Facebook profile and then automatically redirect them to a page deeper in the site. When I try to do this I get the following error from Facebook:</p>

<pre><code>{

<p>""error"": {
      ""type"": ""OAuthException"",
      ""message"": ""Error validating access token.""
   }
}</p>

<p>The problem, it seems, is that although the data in the cookie is invalid it is still in existence. If this is the issue, what can I do to solve it? Is there a call I can make to be sure it is or isn't still valid? Certainly if I put a Facebook login button (it will correctly determine if they are or are not logged in, but I can't very well query the state of the Facebook-rendered button (or at least it wouldn't be a real elegant solution to the problem).

<p>The wikipedia entry talks about responding with forms containing details of the SAMLRequest and SAMLResponse. Does this mean that the user has to physically submit the form in order to proceed with the single sign on?</p>

<p>The google entry talks about using redirects, which seems more seemless to me. However, it also talks about using a form for the response which the user must submit (although it does talk about using JavaScript to automatically submit the form).</p>

<p>Is this the standard way of doing this? Using redirects and JavaScript for form submission?</p>

<p>Does anyone know of any other good resources about how to go about implementing SSO between a Windows Domain and a J2EE web application. The web application is on a separate network/domain.

"OAuth2 ""social login"" flow (allow OAuth2 authentication via Facebook/Twitter): are there any examples/literature?","<p>I'm developing a native mobile app for a custom, web-based social network app. We're building a REST API to communicate with the web server, and we've chosen OAuth2 as the authentication method (the <code>grant_type=password</code> flow).</p>

<p>The web-app allows users to login and signup using external services (ie. Facebook and Twitter). We need to allow the same also on the mobile app. The question is: how can we do that?</p>

<p>The Pinterest mobile app is able to manage the situation (see attached image). What is the flow that's been used here? </p>

<p>Do they behave like a classical OAuth-powered app (the mobile app acting as OAuth client directly with the Facebook API?). If so, then how can the mobile app be authenticated with the   Pinterest server? Is it passing the Facebook OAuth access token as credentials?</p>

<p>I know that I can copy &amp; paste the direct url and update the status with it, however then the post to the timeline shows some long nasty facebook url, rather than just a normal clean share.</p>

"How can I retrieve POST data in Firefox without use of an addon?","<p>This is a bit of an emergency.  I've written a very large article without saving my progress (I know, not the brightest), and when I submitted it, I ended up being redirected to an error.  If I hit the ""Back"" button, then I'm taking to a blank page.  If I hit the ""Refresh"" button on the error page, it tries to resubmit the POST data containing my message (so I know it still exists).</p>

<p>The problem is, I don't own any firefox plugins for viewing the POST data, but I know it's there on the page still, and if I had a method, I would be able to view and retrieve my POST data by refreshing.</p>

<p>I'm using Firefox 10.0.4 on Gentoo.  I do have the greasemonkey plugin installed, but I wasn't able to locate/write a greasemonkey script to do this for me.  I was also unable to find a javascript solution, and every plugin I frantically installed to firefox requires a restart (which will result in losing my POST data forever).</p>

<p>Is there ANY way I could retrieve my POST data in firefox with only the tools I have right now?  Are there any external tools for viewing the post data in memory or as firefox environment variables?</p>

"Facebook data collection ethical issues","<p>If I have a Facebook app, and my users agree to allow my app to access their information, photos, friends, etc, is it ethical to grab their information when they log in, and then saving it in memory so that the next time he goes to my app, it can load faster? </p>

<p>If so, what about when the user logged off? Is the right thing to do to is to delete all the cached information and photos that the user provided? </p>

<p>Has Facebook got any way to detect that we're doing this (saving their information, etc)?</p>

<p>EIDT: Just to be clear, Facebook's term and agreement is not very clear on this matter (agreeing to access information is not always equal to agreeing to have the information stored). As in where I'll be storing the data, it will be just in the user's disk, not my own server. So I can't guarantee that the data is being encrypted securely (If someone steal the phone, that someone will probably be able to get the data)</p>

<p>And yes, my intention is to give my users a better app experience, not anything else.</p>

<p>EDIT2: I'm torn, one answer with very high votes says it's ok because I'm providing a better user experience, but others says I'm breaching privacy. Can anyone provide links to the documentations? Or can more people vote? I'm really glad for the responses!</p>

<p>I don't really care about server farms though and I'd like to simply have an opaque cookie that demonstrates my lack of trust in the callers.</p>

<p>Is there a decent solution that's already been proven solid?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> to clarify my question.  I'm talking about the authentication token part of the forms authentication that I'd like to replace.  The back end is quite easy to replace, you can implement the interfaces to store your users and roles quite easily.  You can also use existing libraries like <a href=""http://www.memberprotect.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.memberprotect.net/</a> which has been mentioned here.</p>

<p>I'd like to change the front end part of the process to use a token that doesn't provide the client with any leverage.  Sticking with the existing back end infrastructure would be useful but not essential.</p>

"drop down menu using css ! wont work with FF","<p>Well just like the title says,<br>
I have created a drop down menu that turns from display:none; to display:block;<br>

when tested with IE &amp; FF, the expected result will trigger only if you click at the<br>
bottom of the li#mtfw scope, when clicking the link with Safari, it doesn’t matter<br>
where you click the drop down menu will appear!

"How does the client browser know to use internet connection of host in home networking","<p>Finally, I am able to setup a basic home network without router. One host laptop running windows 7 is connected to usb data card and other client laptop running XP is able to access internet.</p>

<p>After trying connectify,virtual router etc and ending up with some error, I finally tried adhoc setup on windows 7 native setup, created a network called mynetwork and shared the internet connection. Both machines are on same workgroup, in case it was needed.</p>

<p>Then on XP, I connected to this wireless mynetwork and that's it.
When I tried to browse a site, I was able to!!</p>

<p>But, now this got me thinking, how the client machine browser knows to use internet conenction from host machine. I don't recall having done any manual setup on firefox on client machine to tell it to use myconnection to access internet, then how does it know it? What are the various steps involved? </p>

<p>If I try to break down the steps, when a browser receives a request, it checks for all the currently active network connections. In this client case, only mynetwork wireless network is active, so browser forwards the request to this network using some protocol (what it is called?) and the host machine on receiving this request recognizes that it is an http internet request and uses its local internet connection (because it is setup to share internet) to service the request and forwards the output to the client machine. Is my understanding correct? What all different protocols come into picture here?</p>

- Can you manage custom objects through the open graph?

- I know the linter page used to include a link to the ""admin page"" also. Does it still do this or has this feature been removed?</p>

"Determining if a TLS/SSL certificate is 'trusted' from the command line?","<p>I would like to be able to determine if a remote domain's TLS/SSL certificate is 'trusted' from the command line.</p>

<p>Here is an openssl example I was playing with a few weeks back, here I use openssl to acquire the certificate and then pipe it to openssl's 'verify' command. I assumed that the 'verify' command would verify the certificate, however, how I understand it now is that the 'verify' command just verifies the certificate chain (I think). (cdn.pubnub.com is just a domain I found from a quick Twitter search as an example to use)</p>

<pre><code>echo ""GET /"" | openssl s_client -connect cdn.pubnub.com:443 | openssl x509 -text | openssl verify
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see from the <a href=""https://cdn.pubnub.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">cdn.pubnub.com</a> domain (at the time of writing), the browser (Chrome at least) does not trust the certificate (because the certificate domain doesn't match), however, the openssl 'verify' command does not output 'trusted' or 'not trusted' or something else we can deduct that information from.</p>

<p>Another way I thought of doing this, is by using a headless browser (such as <a href=""http://phantomjs.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">PhantomJS</a>) and parsing any errors they return. It turns out that PhantomJS just errors but does not give any details, so this can not be used as the error could have been caused by something else.</p>

<p>I didn't think it would be this hard to find out that a certificate was trusted or not from the command line, without having to parse and check all the data that makes a certificate trusted myself which I don't think would be wise.</p>

<p>Is there a library or some other way I can tell if a remote domain's certificate is trusted from the command line?</p>

"Excel 2010 files that were previously read only are now writeable","<p>We upload Excel files to several directories on a web server for opening via an intranet site.  Previously, when clicking a URL to open one of these files, a prompt would appear to either Open or Save the file.  If clicking Open, the server file would open but would present a Read Only message upon clicking the Save button within Excel, preventing a write to that server file.</p>

<p>After upgrading some of our users to Office 2010, when opening a file the same message appears and the user is prevented from saving.  However, after closing the document and clicking the same link again, a different prompt appears with a ""do you want to open this file?"" message and Yes and No buttons - no option to save anymore.  When the document opens it becomes write-able to the server.</p>

<p>I've noticed that for each directory that files are stored on the web server, the original message pops up the first time a file in that specific directory is opened, then all files in the directory become write-able.</p>

<p>Hoping someone else has seen this and found a solution so we can track down what permission change is occurring and prevent it from happening.  None of the security settings appear to be getting modified on the server directories, so I'm not sure what's going on.</p>

"file upload security, htaccess, and changing extensions","<p>all.  I'm pretty new to web development, so please be gentle.  Apologies if I'm posting a topic that's already been discussed; I searched but couldn't find quite what I was looking for in another thread.  </p>

<p>Background:  I have a site that allows file uploads, but once uploaded, they won't need to be viewed by anyone but me.  I've implemented some security measures such as having the php upload script only allow certain extensions, chmoding uploaded files to 0644, and using -ExecCGI for various extensions in an htaccess file inside the uploads folder.  </p>

<p>The questions (three of them; aren't you lucky): </p>

<p>1) I'd like to have my htaccess file rewrite php extensions as something else.  I found a bit of code to do this, but can't seem to get it to work:</p>

<pre><code>RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_METHOD} ^PUT$ [OR]
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_METHOD} ^MOVE$
RewriteRule ^(.*)\.php /site_redone/uploads/$1.nophp
</code></pre>

<p>the site structure goes like this (at least for now while I'm redoing the site):
mysite.com/site_redone/uploads</p>

<p>I know that the host of my shared server allows mod_rewrite.  They're running php 5.2.10.  Not sure if my problem is a path issue (I haven't quite grasped that part yet), but have tried various path permutations in the RewriteRule part to no avail.</p>

<p>2) I currently have the file names being appended with a kind of time stamp (time()) to prevent overwriting by a file of the same name, so for example, myfile.doc becomes myfile1252087685.doc.  I can store the extension in a MySQL database and just rewrite the file name to end in .txt or something in my php upload script, but I'm not sure if that'll accomplish the same thing as the above mod_rewrite attempt.</p>

<p>3)  Is there a way to put the htaccess file in a higher directory from the uploads folder so it can't get overwritten my some ne'erdowell while it's in the uploads folder?  I only want it to affect the uploads folder, not the directory in which it's placed, though.  I'm guessing this somehow involves using Directory, but I don't know how to do that.  Did I mention I'm new at this?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

"Redirecting Facebook 'offline_access' permission page","<p>I am trying to get users' permission for 'offline_access' in an iFrame Facebook application coded with the Facebook Java API. I understand that I need to obtain an 'indefinite session key' after the users approves my application. Currently, I can accomplish what I want, but in a very awkward way that is probably not correct. There must be a better way to do this. Any thoughts/ideas would be appreciated!!</p>

<h2>What I've done</h2>

<p>In a servlet of my app, I check to see if the user currently has 'offline_access' permission. If they do, I get the url by <code>Permission.authorizeUrl(Permission.OFFLINE_ACCESS)</code>. I then call <code>response.redirect</code> to get to the permissions page. Two problems I'm having are:</p>

<ol>
<li>The redirected permissions page is displayed within the iFrame. Hence, the Facebook book home menu bar etc. are displayed twice. i.e. looking like an app is embedded in another app. </li>
<li>The user will be 'stuck' on the permission page once redirected there. I won't be able to obtain the 'indefinite session key' (by calling <code>client.getCacheSessionKey</code>) unless the user goes back to a page in my app manually. </li>
</ol>

<h2>Possible Work-arounds??</h2>

<ul>
<li>Is there a way to open/redirect to the permissions page in a new window? That way maybe I can have a thread in my servlet to keep checking whether the permission is set after the redirection. And then I can get the 'indefinite session key' once I have it and store it somewhere?</li>
<li>Is there a way to set an URL for Facebook to go to after permission is set? (much like the pre-auth and post-auth URL settings?) Or somehow take control after the permission page is hit?</li>
<li>Any other ways to setup my app maybe?? Being a newbie, I might've totally gotten the idea wrong...</li>

<li>bar</li>
<li>company</li>
<li>cafe</li>
<li>hotel</li>
<li>restaurant</li>

"How to count how many rows contain particular values in a particular set of cells in libreoffice and excel","<p>This Calc file : <a href=""http://dropcanvas.com/521xc/107"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dropcanvas.com/521xc/107</a> have a sheet called ""Etat"" and a sheet called ""Total"".</p>

<p>In Etat.F20 I have a formula that counts how many rows in Total have the value ""Bug"" in the D column AND the value ""Basse"" in the E column.</p>

<p>I'm doing that with the help of this formula : </p>

<p><code>=SUMPRODUCT($Total.D$1:D$1048576=""Bug"",$Total.E$1:E$1048576=""Basse"")</code></p>

<p>This works fine in LibreOffice, but not in Excel. In Excel, I was told to use N() around the logical comparisons, to get a value out of it, because Excel can't evaluate logical expressions inside SUMPRODUCT formulas.</p>

<p><code>=SOMMEPROD(N(Total!D:D=""Bug"");N(Total!E:E=""Basse""))</code></p>

<p>Which works great, except not in Libreoffice :'(</p>

<p>So I now have two different formulas, one for libreoffice Calc and one for MS Excel. </p>

<p>What I want is just one formula that would work on both softwares. Any ideas ?</p>

<p>I tried various variations of the Excel formula, but none worked in libreoffice Calc</p>

<p>With comas</p>

<p><code>=SUMPRODUCT(N($Total.D$1:D$1048576=""Bug""),N($Total.E$1:E$1048576=""Basse""))</code></p>

<p>With additions</p>

<p><code>=SUMPRODUCT(N($Total.D$1:D$1048576=""Bug"") * N($Total.E$1:E$1048576=""Basse""))</code></p>

<p>With multiplications</p>

<p><code>=SUMPRODUCT(N($Total.D$1:D$1048576=""Bug"") + N($Total.E$1:E$1048576=""Basse""))</code></p>

<p>PS : the original file was made on excel with COUNTIFS instead of SUMPRODUCT, but COUNTIFS isn't present in Libreoffice. Someone showed me the SUMPRODUCT trick but as you can see I'm not sure I'm using it correctly.</p>

"Excel - Formula Cell Entry by Click, can I get eg $A$1 instead of A1?","<p>It is possible in Excel to create a cell reference using <code>$</code> to prevent Excel from incrementing the row/column designator when the formula is copied. IE, if you fill a formula containing the reference <code>$A$1</code> across a row, every pasted formula will remain referencing <code>$A$1</code>.  However, if you do not manually add the <code>$</code> prefix, the row/column designator will increment automatically.</p>

<p>When you enter formula entry mode and then click on another cell, that cell's reference will be insert at the cursor's position inside the formula.</p>

<p>Is there a modifier combo I can hold such that clicking on cell A1 will result in `$A$1' being entered into the formula, so I don't have to key in the $ after clicking?</p>

Yes, I considered using $_SESSION to do this, but in this case, if someone is willing to ""forge"" their willingness to view such content, I could care less if they have access to the cookie. </p>

<p>Since the form in the edit form is for @user which is set to current_user and requires an authenticity token, even if I tried to put in details for the other user I end up changing my own account instead of the other users.</p>

<p>That's nice and good, but I'd like it so that these hackers get redirected before they even see the form.</p>

end

<p>The values of A, B, C, and R are passed to the function that returns the values of X.  The VBA code is below.</p>

<pre><code>Option Base 1
Function TRIDI(ByVal Ac As Range, ByVal Bc As Range, ByVal Cc As Range, _

ReDim A(N), B(N), C(N), R(N), X(N)
For i = 1 To N

B(i) = Bc.Parent.Cells(Bc.Row + i - 1, Bc.Column)
C(i) = Cc.Parent.Cells(Cc.Row + i - 1, Cc.Column)
R(i) = Rc.Parent.Cells(Rc.Row + i - 1, Rc.Column)
Next i
A(N) = A(N) / B(N)
R(N) = R(N) / B(N)
For i = 2 To N
II = -i + N + 2
BN = 1 / (B(II - 1) - A(II) * C(II - 1))
A(II - 1) = A(II - 1) * BN
R(II - 1) = (R(II - 1) - C(II - 1) * R(II)) * BN
Next i
X(1) = R(1)
For i = 2 To N
X(i) = R(i) - A(i) * X(i - 1)

<p>The function works fine for linear equations.  If the equations are nonlinear, for example for the three equations below</p>

<a href=""https://developers.facebook.com/apps/199460733470271/opengraph/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developers.facebook.com/apps/199460733470271/opengraph/</a> 
up to the step to publish actions. 
That procedure does not lend itself to our type of desktop app. Our app does not have a web site since it is a standalone desktop app. briefly it is an unattended kiosk that allows users to login to their facebook account (currently just mine) and select and print photos. Our company is planning many kiosks, and is currently waiting for approval on this app. </p>

<p>We monitor these kiosks remotely using LogMeInPro:
<a href=""https://secure.logmein.com/login.asp?ReturnUrl=%2fCentral.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">https://secure.logmein.com/login.asp?ReturnUrl=%2fCentral.aspx</a>
We would be pleased to provide a login so a facebook approver could remotely test the app. We would also share our code.</p>

<p>Please advise me on how to proceed to get this application approved.

"Deleting Sharepoint Files using XMLHTTP","<p>Following on from this excellent piece of work, here:
<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12039730/batch-copy-files-to-sharepoint-site"">Batch copy files to SharePoint site</a></p>

<p>I can now upload my zipped files to Sharepoint with a click of a button.</p>

<p>My problem is now thus: How do I delete the files I upload using the same method?</p>

<p>I've amended the code slightly to save different files to different SharePoint folders.
Sample below:</p>

<p><pre> <code>

Dim f As File</p>

<p>'Parent Sharepoint
sharepointUrl = ""[SHAREPOINT PATH HERE]""</p>

<p>'Sets the Month%20Year
strMonthYear = Format(Now(), ""mmmm yyyy"") &amp; ""\""</p>

<p>'File Path
strFilePath = ""[ARCHIVE DRIVE]"" &amp; strMonthYear</p>

<p>'Check to see if DRA for current month%20year exists
If Len(Dir(strFilePath, vbDirectory)) = 0 Then
    MkDir ""strFilePath""
End If</p>

<p>Set LobjXML = CreateObject(""Microsoft.XMLHTTP"")</p>

<p>'Where we're uploading files from
Set fldr = fso.GetFolder(strFilePath)</p>

<p>For Each f In fldr.Files</p>

<p>If Format(f.DateCreated, ""dd/mm/yyyy"") = Format(Now(), ""dd/mm/yyyy"") Then</p>

<pre><code>If InStr(1, f.Name, ""[FILESTRING1]"", vbTextCompare) &gt; 0 Then
sharepointFolder = ""[SHAREPOINTSTRING1]/""
    ElseIf InStr(1, f.Name, ""[FILESTRING2]"", vbTextCompare) &gt; 0 Then
    sharepointFolder = ""[SHAREPOINTSTRING2]""
        ElseIf InStr(1, f.Name, ""[DONOTUPLOADTHISFILE]"", vbTextCompare) &gt; 0 Then
        GoTo NextF:
            Else
            sharepointFolder = ""[SHAREPOINTMAINFOLDER]""
End If
</code></pre>

<p>sharepointFileName = sharepointUrl &amp; sharepointFolder &amp; f.Name</p>

<pre><code>PstrFullfileName = strFilePath &amp; f.Name
LlFileLength = FileLen(PstrFullfileName) - 1

' Read the file into a byte array.

  Set fso = Nothing</p>

"Getting Security Exception SQLCE 4, Code First CTP 5 & Shared Hosting","<p>I've been trying to setup a webpage with MVC3 Razor, SQLCE 4 and Code First, the last two downloaded from Nuget, so it is EF Code First CTP5.</p>

<p>I've had a lot of trouble, but I manage to move forward by following <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4762857/using-sql-server-ce-4-on-a-remote-host-with-mvc-3/4903788#4903788"">this answer</a></p>

<p>However now I am getting this Security Exception</p>

<p><strong>Description</strong>: <code>The application attempted to perform an operation not allowed by the security policy. To grant this application the required permission please contact your system administrator or change the application's trust level in the configuration file.</code> </p>

<p>I thought it should work without full trust so I don't know what is wrong now.</p>

<p>I am using GoDaddy shared hosting with .Net 4 and IIS7</p>

<p>What could be the issue?</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>I haven't modified the web.config, except for setting custom errors = false to be able to see the exceptions, otherwise I have the webconfig that was generated by using Nuget to get and configure SQLCE and Code first</p>

"What ""tools"" are needed to make a social browser game?","<p><strong>Background info:</strong>
I've recently decided to take on a project of making a social browser game. I have nothing large in mind at the moment, but in particular I want to experiment with making a facebook app for fun, that me and my friends can play (perhaps it gets more popular, but let me not get sidetracked).</p>

<p>Firstly, I would like to state that I feel I am above average at programming in general (I have developed a php/mysql website, made a rough 3d game engine in java, some embedded C programming, etc - to give an idea of the level of help I require). As stated, I know php and I can work with sql databases. My javascript is perhaps mediocre as I have not used it extensively, but I am learning and not finding it too difficult. I don't know flash at all, but it seems the trend is towards html5 and canvas.</p>

<p><strong>To-the-point-question:</strong> I would like to start with html5+javascript, mySQL database and php. However, I am not too sure how to integrate this into a game. My main concern is what tool to use for communication between client and server. Am I wrong in saying that all relevant calculations (for instance, for resources), are kept server-side as advanced users can possible hack?</p>

<p>Secondly, how would you send data between client and server (obviously posting and reloading the page won't work)? I have used ajax before, but I'm not sure if this is the route to go. </p>

<p>I don't require an intricate answer (although I won't complain if I get one!). I'd be appreciative if someone can simply point me in the right direction. Thank you!</p>

<p>*I guess I should add that the game should be interactive, not text-based (as simply posting would work here)</p>

"JavaScript SDK events don't fire","<p>I am using the JS SDK to tie into facebook.  After initialization (FB.init()), I see the Login button.  After clicking it, it prompts me to login.   Then the dialog just goes away after I log in, despite the fact that I am using FB.Event.subscribe() to add a handler to the auth.login event.</p>

<p>Note that I include the Facebook all.js file using a  tag in html which is processed prior to this code.</p>

<p>here is my code:</p>

<pre><code>FB.init({

                            appId:myId,
                            channelUrl:myChannelUrl,
                            cookie:true,
                            status:true,
                            xfbml:true
                     });
            FB.Event.subscribe('auth.login',function(response) {
                            alert(""your event finally fired!!!"");
            });
            FB.Event.subscribe('auth.logout',function(){
                    alert(""you logged out"");
            });
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>Now, when I log in or log out, NOTHING happens.  The facebook dialog simply goes away.  If I purposely use incorrect credentials to attempt log in, the dialog properly rejects the attempt, which proves that the thing is indeed communicating with facebook.  The trouble seems to be that the event is not firing.</p>

<p>thank you for any guidance here.</p>

"Using Wrapper objects to Properly clean up excel interop objects","<p>All of these questions:</p>

<li><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1372292/how-to-properly-clean-up-interop-objects-in-c"">How to properly clean up interop objects in C#</a></li>
</ul>

<p>struggle with the problem that C# does not release the Excel COM objects properly after using them. There are mainly two directions of working around this issue:</p>

<ol>
<li>Kill the Excel process when Excel is not used anymore.</li>
<li>Take care to explicitly assign each COM object used to a variable first and to guarantee that eventually, Marshal.ReleaseComObject is executed on each.</li>
</ol>

<p>Some have stated that 2 is too tedious and there is always some uncertainty whether you forget to stick to this rule at some places in the code. Still 1 seems dirty and error-prone to me, also I guess that in a restricted environment trying to kill a process could raise a security error.</p>

<p><strong>So I've been thinking about</strong> solving 2 by creating another proxy object model which mimics the Excel object model (for me, it would suffice to implement the objects I actually need). The principle would look as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Each Excel Interop class has its proxy which wraps an object of that class.</li>
<li>The proxy releases the COM object in its finalizer.</li>
<li>The proxy mimics the interface of the Interop class.</li>
<li>Any methods that originally returned a COM object are changed to return a proxy instead. The other methods simply delegate the implementation to the inner COM object.</li>
</ul>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>public class Application
{
    private Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.Application innerApplication
        = new Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.Application innerApplication();

    ~Application()
    {
        Marshal.ReleaseCOMObject(innerApplication);
        innerApplication = null;
    }

    public Workbooks Workbooks
    {
        get { return new Workbooks(innerApplication.Workbooks); }
    }
}

public class Workbooks
{
    private Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.Workbooks innerWorkbooks;

    Workbooks(Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.Workbooks innerWorkbooks)
    {
        this.innerWorkbooks = innerWorkbooks;
    }

    ~Workbooks()
    {
        Marshal.ReleaseCOMObject(innerWorkbooks);
        innerWorkbooks = null;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>My questions to you are in particular:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Who finds this a bad idea and why?</li>
<li>Who finds this a gread idea? If so, why hasn't anybody implemented/published such a model yet? Is it only due to the effort, or am I missing a killing problem with that idea?</li>
<li>Is it impossible/bad/error-prone to do the ReleaseCOMObject in the finalizer? (I've only seen proposals to put it in a Dispose() rather than in a finalizer - why?)</li>
<li>If the approach makes sense, any suggestions to improve it?</li>

"Access token on facebook is invalid - even after making it","<p>I'm writing a facebook application in PHP with the facebook SDK.<br/>
The important parts in my code are:<br/></p>

<pre><code>    $facebook = new Facebook(array(
                'appId' =&gt; $ApplicationID,
                'secret' =&gt; $ApplicationSecret,
                'cookie' =&gt; true, // enable optional cookie support  
            ));
    $user = $facebook-&gt;getUser();

              $post = $facebook-&gt;api('/' . $user . '/feed', 'post', array(
              stuff
      ));
                $_SESSION['finish'] = false;
                $_SESSION['inside'] = 'yes';
                $_SESSION['uid'] = $user;
                $token = $facebook-&gt;getAccessToken();
                echo 'Access token: ' .$token;
                $_SESSION['friends'] = $facebook-&gt;api('/me/friends?access_token'.$token);
</code></pre>

<p>You can see I am <code>echo</code>ing the access token.<br/>
At first, I haven't added the <code>access_token</code> into the query - I just added it for checking.<br/>
The problem is that the last like (with the <code>/me/friends/</code>) throws an exception:</p>

<pre><code>OAuthException: An active access token must be used to query information about the current user.
</code></pre>

<p>Although I did a login, and the <code>feed post</code> <em>did</em> work (I checked at my wall, it's there). Then, my <code>try catch</code> block handles the exception by redirecting to the login link, this way:</p>

<pre><code>catch(Exception $e) {

            $login_url_params = array(
            'scope' =&gt; 'stuff',
            'fbconnect' =&gt; 1,
            'redirect_uri' =&gt; $ApplicationURL
        );
        $login_url = $facebook-&gt;getLoginUrl($login_url_params);

        //redirect to the login URL on facebook
        echo (""EXCPETION! "" . $e . ""&lt;script&gt; top.location.href='"" . $login_url . ""'&lt;/script&gt;"");
        exit();
        }
</code></pre>

<p>The code writing the exception is obviously only for debugging purposes.<br/>
Well, the first time I run the application a similar code is executed by a <code>if(!$user)</code> condition. Then it asks for my permission and I give it. Then, again, it says the access token is invalid (but does post to my wall).<br/>
Please note that I've compared the access_tokens, and even after removing the application and doing it all again - it stayed the same.<br/><br/></p>

<p>This is very awkward behavior and I fail to understand it. May anyone please shred some light on this? <br/>
Edit: For some weird reason, the token doesn't change even after going to a different user. But the post on the wall is still made... (And the exception thrown when accessing the friends list)</p>

"IE8 Win7 Facebook Connect Problem","<p>Update 4/8/09 - I'm into a new week with no progress and no answers from the Facebook forums.  Not one response over there, which is pretty disappointing.  I also cannot figure out how to put a bounty on this question, but I would really, really love to get this issue solved.</p>

<hr>

<p>I have looked at many posts to see if this was posted before, and it was not.  Here's the short version:</p>

<p>I am going through the sample FB Connect tutorial (v1) and cannot make it work in IE8 on Win7.  It works as expected on FF3 on Win7.</p>

<p>Long Version:</p>

<p>I was suprised that things weren't working since I had pretty much copy and pasted over the content.  I skipped over the bit with the alert() javascript call, so I put that in to see if the parser was even getting to that.  I put the following code in:</p>

<pre><code>[my raw html]
Or use, &lt;fb:login-button length=""long"" onlogin=""alert('yo!!!');""&gt;&lt;/fb:login-button&gt;
[/my raw html]
</code></pre>

<p>The Alert is not popping on IE8.  It works on FF.</p>

<p>When I change back to calling the update_user_box(), my HTML looks like:</p>

<pre><code>Or use, &lt;fb:login-button length=""long"" onlogin=""update_user_box();""&gt;&lt;/fb:login-button&gt;

&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
    function update_user_box() {
        var user_box = document.getElementById(""user"");
        user_box.innerHTML =
            ""&lt;span&gt;""
            + ""&lt;fb:profile-pic uid='loggedinuser' facebook-logo='true'&gt;&lt;/fb:profile_pic&gt;""
            + ""Welcome, &lt;fb:name uid='loggedinuser' useyou='false'&gt;&lt;/fb:name&gt;.""
            + ""You are signed in.""
            + ""&lt;/span&gt;""

        FB.XFBML.Host.parseDomTree();
    }

    FB.init(""23e24c73feed7ca0f6afd876575842de"", ""../../Connect/xd_receiver.htm"", { ""ifUserConnected"": update_user_box });
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Again, this works in FF3 just fine.  My picture shows up and everything.  It actually makes me more upset that it worked in FF3 than a complete no work situation.</p>

<p>Here is the witnessed behavior in IE8:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>When I click on the FBConnect button. the javascript window pops up and loads the right logon page</p></li>
<li><p>Focus changes back to the main window (the one with my app)</p></li>
<li><p>The main IE8 window (the one where I clicked the connect button) now shows a facebook logon page.</p></li>
<li><p>When I input my credentials into the FB javascript window, the page loads a blank doc

&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>5, If I close that window and type my credentials into the app window, the page reloads with the FBConnect button.</p>

<p>As I said, I am getting the expected behavior in FF3, but not IE8.  I even tried IE8's compatability mode, but that didn't work either.  Anyone have any clues as to what is happening?</p>

<p>My HTML tag looks like:</p>

<p>The issue is that when I execute this PHP file, i get this error: ""Cannot use string offset as an array in..."".  This error specifically refers to this line of code: $firstName=$user_details[0]['contact_email']; </p>

<p>I'm thinking this is because the user_getInfo method is not returning any results... However, the most ridiculous part about all this is that, I can execute the code below several dozens of times in a row SUCCESSFULLY without the above error, BUT THEN randomly without changing ANY code at all, I will suddenly encounter this error, in which case it will begin to give me an error several dozens of times, and then AGAIN without any code change, start executing successfully again.</p>

<p>This odd behavior occurs regardless of the attribute i am fetching.. (contact_email, first_name, last_name, etc.).  I am running php 5.2.11.  Is there something I'm missing??</p>

<p>Please Help!</p>

<p>include_once 'site/fbconnect/config.php'; //has $api_key and $secret defined.
include_once 'site/facebook-platform/client/facebook.php';
global $api_key,$secret;
$fb=new Facebook($api_key,$secret);
$fb->require_login();
$fb_user=$fb->get_loggedin_user();</p>

<p>$user_details=$fb->api_client->users_getInfo($fb_user,array('last_name','first_name','contact_email'));<br>
$email=$user_details[0]['contact_email'];
$firstName=$user_details[0]['first_name']; 
$lastName=$user_details[0]['last_name'];</p>

"Should email address be stored after logout?","<p>I've written an add-on for a web application that inserts a ""Remember Me"" checkbox into login forms. One of my users expressed surprise that they are not remembered after logging out! Clearly someone who has logged out should stay logged out, and despite a specific request I will not fill the password field as that means storing the password in clear text.</p>

<p>My question is should the email address/username be pre-filled for a login form if a user has previously marked the ""Remember Me"" box?<br>
Obviously if done on a public computer that would be effectively broadcasting their personal details to the next stranger who used that computer, but a user shouldn't use the ""Remember Me"" option on public computers anyway.</p>

<p>What are the security considerations of doing this? Do users expect some of their details to be remembered after logging out?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> It occurs to me that browsers all have a feature to remember form values and login details anyway, perhaps making this unnecessary.</p>

<p>In this html webpage, user hits button to narrow the table. In all browsers except ff, td cell will show scrollbar when it's narrow enough as expected. But in ff 3.5.13(or any version), scrollbar is not showing up.</p>

<p>Any idea, please?</p>

<p>EDIT: after more search on StackOverflow, it turns out ff does not support overflow:auto and overflow:scroll for table or td. ff only supports overflow:visible and overflow:hidden if set table-layout to fixed. So sad!</p>

"facebook like button won't allow comment","<p>I've added the like button to my website trying both the XFBML and HTML5 versions and all three forms of the button layouts to try to fix this problem.  People can like my website, but there is no working comment box.  Strangely, it worked last night, but a friend called me this morning that the comment box comes up, they could type a comment, but nothing at all happens when they click to post it.  I tried it again myself and the comment box flashes up for a split second, only to disappear again without the possibility of leaving a comment.</p>

<p>I am quite knowledgable with coding and I've followed the steps exactly, plugging the generated code into my html as directed.  For the XFBML, the generated JS SDK code has been plugged in right after the opening body tag, I've added the xmlns:fb-""http://ogp.me/ns/fb#"" code into the html tag, and added the button code in my content code.  My data is being recorded in Insights and it even shows that a few comments were recorded yesterday. Any ideas what could be wrong all of a sudden?
Thanks in advance.

"Facebook Auth Dialog (JS) not shows up in IE & Chrome","<p>I am currently developing a Facebook App (it's not my first one) and I encountered some, or a lot of problems.</p>

<p>The index.php file is including the content based on the $_GET['page'] variable. (eg. 'step1', 'step2').</p>

<p>On 'step2', there is a form for uploading the video. The  field has an onChange() event which fires up this code:</p>

<pre><code>function submitForm() {
  console.log('submitting...');
  FB.login(function(response) {
  if (response.authResponse) {
   console.log('Welcome!  Fetching your information.... ');
   FB.api('/me', function(response) {
     console.log('Good to see you, ' + response.name + '.');
     jQuery('#fuserid').val(response.id);

     jQuery('#uploadForm').submit();
     jQuery('.formContent').hide();
     jQuery('.loader').show();
   });
  } else {
   console.log('User cancelled login or did not fully authorize.');
   window.location = ""index.php?page=contest&amp;error=not_authenticated&amp;signed_request="" + ""&lt;?php echo $_REQUEST['signed_request']; ?&gt;""
  }
  }, {scope: 'email,user_birthday,publish_stream,user_likes'});
}
</code></pre>

<p>In Firefox, this works exactly like it should.
In any Internet Explorer version, the Facebook-Authentification popup is not opening, nor is the form submitted or anything.
EXCEPT for when the Developer Tools [those from IE] are activated and open - in this case, everything works in IE.</p>

<p>Chrome is simliar, sometimes the popup is not opening, and I get the following error message:</p>

  js.src = ""//connect.facebook.net/de_DE/all.js#xfbml=1&amp;appId=&lt;?php echo $appID; ?&gt;"";
  fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);
}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
  window.fbAsyncInit = function() { 
    FB.init({ 
      appId      : '&lt;?php echo $appID; ?&gt;', // App ID

"Best place (and time) to insert ACLs/ACEs in n-tiers architecture","<p>With all the processes we need to separate in a scalable web architecture and specifically in an Event Driven Design (synchronous and asynchonous jobs), i wonder where is the best place (and also the best time) to insert ACEs.</p>

<p>My first ""naïve"" move would be to insert them in the same service method the related object is created  in.</p>

<p>It would be something like :</p>

<pre><code>class AlbumManager
{
    public function createAlbum(Album $album)
    {        
        $this-&gt;albumRepository-&gt;save($album);

        $event = new AlbumEvent($album);
        $this-&gt;dispatcher-&gt;dispatch(AlbumEvents::CREATE, $event);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>But, is that the right place ? Since other stuffs are handled in Event Listeners which delegate works synchronously or asynchronously (offline queue), why don't do the same with ACEs ?</p>

<p>Typically, in the application, you always identify the operations that need to be done immediatly, and the ones that can (must) be done offline (queue).</p>

"html() method wrong when input value has changed","<p>Essentially, I have some code that needs to get the HTML of a parent element when any of its input elements blur. That's pretty simple. The problem is that the HTML returned when calling <code>html()</code> on the parent element, does not reflect the current value of the input elements contained within. That is, in Firefox or Chrome. It works in IE of all places.</p>

<p>Here's the JSFiddle: <a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/8PJMx/15/"">http://jsfiddle.net/8PJMx/15/</a></p>

<p>Try changing ""world"" in the textbox to ""everyone"" and clicking the button. Note that I'm also appending <code>$.now()</code> so that you can see that the code is in fact executing.</p>

<p>As you can see, <code>$(""#parent"").html()</code> does not update, even though <code>$(""#child"").val()</code> does. 
For your viewing pleasure, here's the HTML:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id=""parent""&gt;Hello &lt;input type='text' id=""child"" value='world' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;button id=""separateEvent""&gt;Get HTML.&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The HTML for #parent is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;textarea id=""parentsHtml"" style=""width:95%; height: 100px;""&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The value of #child is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;textarea id=""childsValue"" style=""width:95%; height: 100px;""&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>...and here's the JavaScript:</p>

"How to store custom information in SecurityContext of spring-security?","<p>In my application I'm using LDAP authentication.

The method returns security token which makes me able to invoke another methods, i.e. I should pass security token to service methods as first argument.<br>
So I'd like to get these security tokens immediately after successful login using LDAP and store them in SecurityContext.

"How to prevent caret misplacement when deleting elements in a contenteditable div","<p>My application includes a typeahead feature when a user is typing into a comment box.  In a similar fashion to Facebook's and google+'s it will perform a lookup of users and suggest them as tags on the fly.</p>

<p>When a user selects one of the offered tags it gets entered into the input area as an  element.</p>

<p>I decided to use a conenteditable div for this, but have come across a few issues.</p>

<p>It turns out that firefox wont delete the inserted elements when they are set to contenteditable false whereas every other major browser does.</p>

<p>In order to work around this I have set the inserted 'user' tags as contenteditble=true and wrote a quick jquery workaround to solve this issue.</p>

<p>It works perfectly apart from one major issue.  If there are multiple tags in the area and the first of them is not proceeded by any text, then when the user deletes the final one (assuming deletion with the backspace key from right to left) the caret gets positioned incorrectly following that final deletion.</p>

<p>Typing again appears to then return the position to normal.</p>

<p><strong>This issue only occurs in Firefox</strong></p>

<p>Here is a jsFiddle showing the issue:</p>

<p><a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/gordyr/PESky/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jsfiddle.net/gordyr/PESky/</a></p>

<p>Place your cursor at the end of that last tag and then hold down the backspace key until all elements are removed.  You will see that the cursor/caret moves up and out of position.</p>

<p>It is quite possible that this is actually a bug in firefox itself, however I am looking for a workaround of some kind as without this automatic element deletion with javascript, the don't get removed at all.</p>

"Typeof data in GridView/ Listview bound, template and auto-generated fields","<p><strong>Background</strong>: I'm populating lots of asp.net c# GridViews and ListViews from a database and subsequently users may export them to Excel. I want export as native Excel (not html). I can't use office automation, and I'm using JET which works fine. I have no control over users' machines.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Question</strong>: When doing the export, you have to tell Jet what type each field is, in my case ""text"" (varchar) or ""numeric"" (double). The difference is that if you export a numeric column, the users can sum the data in Excel, where as strings are exported with a leading apostrophe and so are not much use in arithmetic.</p>

<p>Currently I parse the first data row of the Grid/ListView, check if each value is numeric or text, and assign a type to the column accordingly. That works, except for when I have something in the first column which looks numeric but in fact is a text string. I don't want to parse every row in order to be sure I have the correct data type as some of these exports are quite large.</p>

<p>When I load the Grid/ListView from the database, the database certainly knows what type each field is. So my question is... how do I extract the type of the database item behind a a Grid/ListView item? I could explicitly code it as an attribute on the item, but that's duplicating information I already have, if only I can get to it.</p>

<p>I know that where I have a DataTable then I can get the underlying type from that, but mostly I don't have tables handy, just the Grid/ListView.</p>

<p>--
(edit)
Note that Jet will throw if you try to insert an empty string into a nullable numeric column. The way to do this is to omit that column name from the insert statement, or output a zero.</p>

"How do I report software vulnerabilities found in an open source library that are widely used but have a dilapidated team structure?","<p>For most open source project, there is a well-founded project team and corporate sponsorship, and a lot of active contributors. The procedure for filing bug reports are clearly documented.</p>

<p>However, there are also some open source project(s) that have been in existence for more than 10 years (maybe 15), and were included in all sorts of free and commercial products (OSes and linux distros, etc), and everyone just assumes it is correct, despite some parts of it in a state of despair and full of bugs.</p>

<p>It appears to me that the real users (programmers in-the-know) simply choose to use the library in a certain way as not to trigger the bug. Few choose to speak up.</p>

<p>There are also big-name companies that fix the bugs quietly (in their own products) without giving out any patches. And use that to their business advantage.</p>

<p>There is no leading developer. There is no information as to who are the active developers, except that you can browse the mailing list and see who has recently submitted patches, and assume that they might know someone who is helpful.</p>

<p>How should I handle a vulnerability case, without leaking information in a way that gives ammunition to the bad guys?</p>

"Feed dialog inside page","<p>I have an application that runs inside a iframe on facebook canvas page. As it is a game, I would like to make it able to allow users to share their score, for this purpose, I've tryed the following:</p>

"How can I get only the users (friends) who are using my app?","<p>I have a PhoneGap app, where I need to list all the user's friends, who have authorized the application on Facebook.</p>

<p>I'm currently using <code>FB.api('/me/friends?fields=installed', callbackFnc)</code>, but this shows me <strong>all</strong> friends, pointing which of them have authorized the app. When I really wanted to list <strong>only</strong> the authorized ones.
This slows a lot the process of loading friends.</p>

"SSRS 2008 and SharePoint integrated mode - security flaw?","<p>Here is my scenario: I've got SSRS 2008 R2 running in integrated mode with SharePoint 2010.
Everything works as expected in that I can create data sources, models (either through studio or via the ""generate model"" option on the ECB for a datasource in a report library). My datasource is using a dedicated SQL account with the stored credentials option. My model specifically hides a couple of columns so that my report builder 3.0 users don't have access to them (consider these sensitive columns). </p>

<p>What I've discovered though is that <strong><em>while a user cannot edit my model or the data source (they only have read access to them), they can (from another report library where they have contribute permissions) create a new report model (from SharEPoint) and simply past the url to the report data source I setup for them in my library</em></strong>. Once they do this, they end up with a model which does not have any of the hidden columns I setup in the locked-down model. This model also does not have any of the model item security settings I have applied - it's a brand new model only using the data source.</p>

<p>So here is my question: Microsoft implies that report model item security can be used to prevent users from accessing certain entities in the model (hence the term ""report model item security""). <strong>But if users can simply create there own model using the SharePoint UI from a report library of their own creation and point to the datasource (.rsds file) that they have to have read access to, isn't this a bit of a security flaw?</strong></p>

"Is closed-source code more secure than open-source?","<p>My computing teacher told us that closed source software is more secure than open source software, because with open source ""anyone can modify it and put stuff in."" This is why they do not want to use open source alternatives for learning to program, such as FreePascal (currently using Embarcadero Delphi, which is slow and buggy.)</p>

<p>I think this is completely wrong. For example Linux seems to be considerably more resilient to exploits than Windows; although it could be down to popularity/market share.</p>

<p>What studies have been performed which show that open source or closed source is better in terms of security?</p>

"Like action not showing on users wall","<p>I've spent several days attempting to resolve this issue without success. The issue is that when a user clicks on a like button it does not indicate that they like anything on their wall. While the code works correctly on my test setup at localhost, it does not work in production.</p>

<p>My client is using an image gallery plugin for wordpress along with a lightbox plugin known as FancyBox to show larger versions of images when a user clicks on the thumbnail. He has asked me to add a facebook like button to each fancybox.</p>

<p>Since fanyboxes are dynamically generated, I generate a new like button iframe whenever a fancybox is rendered. The URL used by the like button iframe is unique to the picture clicked on by the user. The code adds &amp;photo=/location/of/photo.jpg to the gallery URL. Then the entire custom URL is passed through encodeURIComponent() and handed to the iframe.</p>

<p>Here is the code snippet used to generate the iframe</p>

<pre><code>var currentURL = document.URL,  
    currentIMG = $(""#fancybox-img"").attr(""src"").split(""http://www.downsplash.com"").pop();  
if (currentURL.match(""&amp;photo="")) {  
    var currentURL = currentURL.split(""&amp;photo="").shift();
};
var thisURL = encodeURIComponent(currentURL + ""&amp;photo="" + currentIMG);
&lt;span id=""fancybox-title-over""&gt;
    &lt;div id=""facebook-like"" style=""display:inline-block;""&gt;
        &lt;iframe src=""//www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href="" + thisURL + ""&amp;amp;send=false&amp;amp;layout=button_count&amp;amp;width=80&amp;amp;show_faces=true&amp;amp;action=like&amp;amp;colorscheme=dark&amp;amp;font&amp;amp;height=21&amp;amp;appId=314592468583405"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""0"" style=""border:none; overflow:hidden; width:80px; height:21px;"" allowTransparency=""true""&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;  
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><a href=""http://www.downsplash.com/?portfolio=portraits"" rel=""nofollow"">Here is a link to the code running in production.</a></p>

<p>The like button code seems to work without a hitch, it allows you to like and unlike photos. The only issue is that when a photo is liked, nothing appears on the users wall.</p>

<p>Notes:</p>

<ol>
<li>Everything works correctly when using just the base URL without the

It obviously has to do with security - if I can't see the table in object explorer, it won't let me access it through SMO.  Anyone have any ideas of a workaround or alternate method to allow me to generate a script?</p>

"Why does the Authorization line change for every firefox request?","<p>When running with Kerberos tickets, I have noticed that every firefox request has a different Authorization line in the HTTP header.  I loaded a simple page, then hit the reload button several times and it was never the same.  What causes this behavior?  I would have thought that the Authorization line would stay constant for the duration of the Kerberos credentials.  (Note that I got the credentials via the kinit command before firing up firefox.)</p>

<p>When the authentication method is Basic, then firefox continues to send the same base64 string of 'user:password' every time.  This is the behavior I expected.</p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

"Retrieving albums from age-restricted (alcohol) pages results in ""An unknown error occurred""","<p>I've noticed when doing a Facebook Graph API call to retrieve a list of photo albums on an age-restricted page the following error occurs:</p>

<pre><code>{error_code: 1, error_msg: ""An unknown error occurred""}
</code></pre>

<p>I've tried both the JS API and the PHP API, same results. </p>

<p>For testing purposes, I am using an age-restricted page I created myself (permission set to Alcohol-related). I also have double checked that I am using a valid auth_token that has full permission to read and write photos to the page.</p>

<pre><code>$albums = $facebook-&gt;api('/me/albums', 'GET', array(
  'access_token' =&gt; 'XXX'

<p>Please note the same code works fine on non-age restricted pages.</p>

<p>I should also mention, if I grab an album_id manually from Facebook, I have no problems posting photos to that album. The problem only seems to be with listing the albums.</p>

<p>Is this a bug on Facebook's side, or is there an extra step one must take for age-restriced pages?</p>

<p>My logout code:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a href=""/"" onclick=""FB.logout();""&gt;Logout&lt;/a&gt;

<p>The login works perfectly and I can execute api calls no problem.  However, after I logout, I get the following error:</p>

<pre><code>OAuthException: Error validating access token: The session is invalid because the user logged out.  app/controllers/application_controller.rb:58: in 'fbookinvite_check'

<p>The problem seems to be that the cookie is that the access token is invalidated, @graph is not showing as nil after the redirect.  If I refresh, then the page loads no problem, but I get the error when I log out.</p>

"Why does MySQL replication use five certificates?","<p>I'm attempting to set up MySQL replication with SSL encryption, and while I'm beginning to close in on the solution, there's one aspect of the process that I can't wrap my brain around relating to the way MySQL uses SSL.</p>

<p>According to the documentation on MySQL 5.0 (<a href=""http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/secure-create-certs.html"" rel=""nofollow"">setting up SSL for client/server</a> and <a href=""http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/replication-solutions-ssl.html"" rel=""nofollow"">setting up SSL for replication</a>), the SSL connection can involve up to five pieces of information: the CA cert, the master's signed public and private keys, and the slave's signed public and private keys. What I don't understand is the need for these five components. My understanding of SSL (gleaned from <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport%5FLayer%5FSecurity#How%5Fit%5Fworks"" rel=""nofollow"">the Wikipedia entry</a>) is that SSL generally requires only three pieces: the CA certificate (shared by server and client), the server's public key (sent to the client, validated against the CA cert, and used to encrypt / decrypt communication to the server), and the server's private key (kept by the server and use to encrypt / decrypt communication to client). </p>

<p>So why in the MySQL replication SSL solution does the slave also have a public/private key pair signed against the same CA cert as the master's public/private key pair?</p>

"Securing paths in PHP","<p>I'm writing some PHP which takes some paths to different content directories, and uses these to include various parts of pages later. I'm trying to ensure that the paths are as they seem, and none of them break the rules of the application. Which are,</p>

<li><code>PRIVATEDIR</code> (defined relative to <code>DOCUMENT_ROOT</code>) must be above <code>DOCUMENT_ROOT</code>.</li>
<li><code>CONTENTDIR</code> (defined relative to <code>PRIVATEDIR</code>) must lie below <code>PRIVATEDIR</code> and must not go back in to <code>DOCUMENT_ROOT</code>.</li>
<li>The remaining <code>*DIRS</code>'s (defined relative to <code>CONTENTDIR</code>) must lie below <code>CONTENTDIR</code></li>

}
</code></pre>

<p>The thing is this seems like a lot of work to do, especially as it must be run, every time a page is accessed, before I can do anything else (e.g check for a cached version of the page I'm serving), when the paths are essentially static.</p>

<p>Part of me is thinking that the maintainer (currently me) of the site should be aware of what paths they are supplying and should check themselves that they conform to the rules. But the (I think) more sensible side of me is saying, no, I should be equally responsible for checking that the paths conform, since accidents do happen (especially as the site grows/changes/gets a new maintainer...) and if they can be caught, in a security-critical environment, there is no excuse not to catch them.</p>

<p>So, I'm pretty much decided that I DO want to check these paths, the question is how good is my method? It feels like a suboptimal solution. How would you improve it or what alternatives would you suggest? Is there anyway of getting round the problem of having to do it every time a page loads, and somehow just do it when the configuration changes? (That would be ideal, but I don't imagine trivial).</p>

"How to sort NSMutableArray key by date (Facebook Birthdays?)","<p>Im trying to use NSSortDescriptor to sort the NSMutableArray *friends, key:birthday, by date, I'm  getting null for all the birthdays in my NSLog, however the names are still logging.  If I pull out my NSSortDescriptor my NSLog will give me the values again, wondering why i lose the values in passing them through the NSSortDescriptor, and how I can pull this off.  Im using the Hackbook sample code to learn Facebook integration, and have modified the code to give me my friends birthdays, and id like to have them sorted January - December in format 1/1 - 12/31  Is it because of the randomizing pull of resultData of a friends list?

I want to also mention, VERY IMPORTANT, that i have extended permissions, and this is not a permission issue, its something im doing wrong when i try to sort the array, and i believe my inexperience is my own worst enemy here.

"Facebook Like Button in Blogger classic template with HTML5 Multiple problems","<p>Using HTML5 from the Facebook Developers page, I added the SDK, and the standard HTML5 code to add a like button. It appears that the default behavior was to register a ""like"" of the individual blog post, and then also offer a dialog box to enter a comment and link to the Blogger post which would then post to the activity wall. I quickly realized that in order to post likes regarding specific posts, I had to use ""data-href=''"" in the code, otherwise, the links would always be to the home page of the blog.</p>

<p>I had this all working, but Facebook was grabbing a wrong, random image from my page, and then several more things failed, which are perhaps related?</p>

<p>I guess because I tested too many times, the ""Confirm"" link started appearing, and I understand that I need for that to cycle itself back out. Clicking the confirm link still works for registering a proper, permalinked, ""Like,"" but now the dialog that appears, which should allow a comment to be entered and then post the comment and link to the wall opens, but will not save.</p>

<p>I thought perhaps my failure to include Open Graph Tags might be the issue, and so I added those tags. Now:</p>

<p>• the ""Like"" grabs the right image but reverts to the home page URL which is in the OG Tags.
• the ""Share"" button no longer shares the permalink, but also uses the home page URL.
• the dialog for comment and posting to activity still doesn't work, but also isn't grabbing the permalink either.</p>

<p>If I remove the OG tags, all buttons grab the proper permalink, but the wrong image.</p>

<p>What do I need to do to get the Comment dialog to work?
How do I configure OG tags so that the image can be correct AND have the permalink URLS work?</p>

<p>Here a portions of relevant code and URLS:</p>

<p>But in Firefox, and IE 8, the other elements of the page are displayed, and only the likes/dislikes take some time. But the advantage is that they are displayed as soon as they are loaded. So this is much better.</p>

"php security on a system with only known php software (or: need alternative non-PHP CMS)","<p>I have a deep antipathy for PHP due to its security record and the way the project handles security in general. Unfortunately I have to deploy a CMS and I need a modern theme for it. So far I have looked almost everywhere but it always comes down to a PHP based CMS because that is what the masses are using and the designers are designing for. :(</p>

<p>Now I've settled for Drupal which is a properly maintained project and handles security flaws exemplary. But there is still the bitter after taste of having to publicly deploy php in general.</p>

<p>So far what I have done is:</p>

<ul>
<li>chained PHP with PHP-FPM: sockets, chroot, unpriviledged own user, ...</li>
<li>hardened the filesystem permissions around my web root</li>
<li>stayed on PHP 5.3.x w/ suhosin active (no suhosin yet for 5.4.x)</li>
<li>kept every module out of PHP that Drupal does not need</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>

<p>My main concern is PHP, in all honesty. What else can I do to secure the host machine? And to those who have more experience with Drupal and PHP (being a C++ dev myself), how much of a security risk does PHP really pose on a system that does only deploy one known package and no user PHP scripts or anything alike?</p>

<p>Even if it may sound like it, I am no Linux or server newbie. :) PHP is just not my main play area due to its recurring and ongoing bad press and my lack of interest in web development...</p>

<p>Alternatively, I would really like to use a CMS that relies on Perl, Python or even Ruby. So if anyone knows a good CMS system that has good paid themes available, supports a flexible layout along with a blog engine and also supports PostgreSQL (the db of my choice), I'd be all ears...</p>

<p>Thanks for taking the time to read through this somewhat strange posting. :-)</p>

"Enable built-in Office ribbon buttons which are disabled by Excel/PPT","<p>It is well documented how built-in ribbon buttons in Microsoft Office can be repurposed (<a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb462633%28v=office.12%29.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">here for instance</a>), e.g. the Copy button.

Until i was not removing elements the code was working fine but removing element is neccessary because say a user doesnt enter any value in text box 1 on first attempt so an <code>h3</code> element would be added but now he enters some text in first text box but leaves second text box empty so the <code>h3</code> element of first text box should dissappear.</p>

"Spring Switching User: only allow a user with a specific role switch to another user with specific roles","<p>I'm making a web application with Spring Security with 3 different roles:</p>

<ul>
<li>SuperSupporter</li>
<li>DivisionSupporter</li>
<li>Client</li>
</ul>

<p>Currently my application <strong>allow SuperSupporter to ""impersonate"" DivisionSupporter by using <a href=""http://static.springsource.org/spring-security/site/docs/3.0.x/apidocs/org/springframework/security/web/authentication/switchuser/SwitchUserFilter.html"" rel=""nofollow"">SwitchUserFilter</a></strong>, for him to act as that DivisionSupporter. This is necessary in case a DivisionSupporter meet some problems - and needs supported. This may sound strange, but it's kind of using TeamViewer to examine the computer problem for a friend.</p>

<p>Further more, now we need give the <strong>DivisionSupporter</strong> the right to ""impersonate"" the Client, so that the DivisionSupporter can ""support"" the Client.</p>

<p>But the thing makes me worried is that if we give the <strong>DivisionSupporter</strong> the right to access <code>j_spring_security_switch_user</code>, malicious DivisionSupporter may use it to impersonate the SuperSupporter (by posting with to the link with the according username).</p>

<p>I have thought of a work around to stop that case:</p>

<pre><code> &lt;bean id=""switchUserFilter"" class=""org.springframework.security.web.authentication.switchuser.SwitchUserFilter""&gt;
        &lt;property name=""userDetailsService"" ref=""userDetailsService"" /&gt;
        &lt;property name=""switchUserUrl"" value=""/j_spring_security_switch_user"" /&gt;
        &lt;property name=""exitUserUrl"" value=""/j_spring_security_exit_user"" /&gt;
        &lt;property name=""targetUrl"" value=""/checkRole.html"" /&gt;
     &lt;/bean&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>In <code>/checkRole</code> action (which is the targetUrl), I make another check: if the user role is SuperSupporter and he is impersonate someone, the application will send him to <code>/j_spring_security_exit_user</code> (because a SuperSupporter won't need to impersonate 
himself).</p>

<p>Though it seems work, but I'm worried that a malicious user may find a way to work around this wall, and hence put our system in danger.</p>

<p>I think that SpringSecurity may have someway to address this needs, but still not able to find it. Is this way really safe? Can the DivisionSupporter work around to impersonate the SuperSupporter with my current solution?</p>

<p>More importantly, is there any better way to address this problem?</p>

<p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>

"Securing RDP for a public web server","<p>I'm a developer of a server-based web application. My client has organised a virtual server to be hosted with one of their ISPs. The server is running Windows Server 2008 R2. It's a completely standalone machine (i.e. no domain, no policies pushed down, etc) and I have total control over it. I should note that while I know a reasonable amount about Windows, I'm not a server admin myself and don't know a great deal about how to manage servers.</p>

<p>However, the ISP doesn't provide any sort of VPN or other security for accessing the machine. They've opened the ports I need publicly open, but the RDP ports are causing me some concern. I need to be able to RDP in from a few machines, and unfortunately some of these have dynamic IPs due to being mobile machines.</p>

<p>Although the application is minimal risk, I still really don't like having RDP open to the world as well - unfortunately, the options they've given me are:</p>

<ul>
<li>open RDP to the world so I can use Windows Firewall on the server to manage the IPs that are allowed to access the machine</li>
<li>open RDP to specific IPs at their firewall level</li>
</ul>

  var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];

</code></pre>

<p>The strange stuff:
When I started out on it I was using the admins ID provided by the client and when running the url through fb linter, the only error it gave is
 <code>Object at URL 'http://client.in.qa/product/product1234' of type 'product' is invalid because the given value '000000' for property 'fb:admins' could not be parsed as type 'fbid'.</code> but when I looked at the response in Firebug after clicking 'like', the error mentioned invalid app_id. </p>

<p>At that point I'd click the button, the count would increment and immediately revert, but it would show up on my wall.</p>

<p>So I set up a test app on FB and entered the <code>client.in.qa</code> as App Domain and <code>http://client.in.qa</code> as Website and used my own app id on fb:admins meta-tag. </p>

<p>Then the 'like' count would increment and hold. I thought all's well. But..., turns out it does not work on all products. And the same error shows up on linter, even for the product pages where the buttons seems to work as expected.  </p>

<p>Clicking the URLs Graph API reveals:</p>

<pre><code>{
   ""error"": {
      ""message"": ""An unknown error has occurred."",
      ""type"": ""OAuthException"",
      ""code"": 1
   }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>UPDATE:
It seems that until FB crawls the site the only way to get consistent behavior is run the url to be liked through the linter. Then the little preview shows up when I try to 'Like' it and the count 'sticks' </p>

<p>This reads in the <em>entire</em> second column as <code>NA</code>.  I think this is due to the fact it's <em>guessed</em> to be logical, and therefore the subsequent numbers are assessed as invalid and hence <code>NA</code>. </p>

<p>I am trying to find a way to prevent this coercion to logical, which I think is causing the subsequent error. </p>

<p>I found <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9062761/annoying-feature-or-bugs-for-rodbc"">this</a> Q+A by searching SO, however I am at work and have no hope of being permitted to edit the registry to change the default for DWORD, as <a href=""http://support.microsoft.com/kb/189897/EN-US"" rel=""nofollow"">suggested</a> (I understand that the value set here determines how many NAs are required before Microsoft guesses the data type and bombs my read). </p>

<p>Right now, I'm thinking that the best solution is to invert the data in Excel, and read it into R up-side-down. </p>

"FireFox and IE convert original color values to RGB","<p>UPDATE: the problem is with FF's .cloneNode() method: <a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/beCVL/1/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jsfiddle.net/beCVL/1/</a></p>

<p>I know FF and IE internally convert color to RGB, which causes problem, because the color values don't match what is on the server.</p>

<p>Proof:</p>

<pre><code>Chrome 18:
CKEDITOR.instances.selected_text_actual.getData()
&gt;&gt; ""s &lt;span style=""color: #ff0000""&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;""

FireFox 11:
CKEDITOR.instances.selected_text_actual.getData()
&gt;&gt; ""s &lt;span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);""&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;""
</code></pre>

<p>So, the way I want to solve the problem is to make CKEditor's data processor always use the rgb values. Is there a way to do that?</p>

<p>I found that something like this should work:</p>

<pre><code>CKEDITOR.on( 'instanceReady', function( ev ){
            var editor = ev.editor,
                dataProcessor = editor.dataProcessor,
                htmlFilter = dataProcessor &amp;&amp; dataProcessor.htmlFilter;

            // HTML 4 way to end tags
            dataProcessor.writer.selfClosingEnd = '&gt;';

            htmlFilter.addRules({
                elements:{
                    $:function(element){
                        var e = jQuery(element);
                        e.css(""color"", e.css(""color"")); // jquery auto converts to rgb
                    }
                }
            });

        });

<p>Source: <a href=""http://sebduggan.com/blog/customising-ckeditor-settings-in-mura/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sebduggan.com/blog/customising-ckeditor-settings-in-mura/</a>
but, there is no change. </p>

<p>The conversion to RGB is pretty straight forward:</p>

<pre><code>a.attr(""style"", ""color: #444"")
[
&lt;div style=​""color:​ #444""&gt;​&lt;/div&gt;​
]
a.css(""color"", a.css(""color""));
[
&lt;div style=​""color:​ rgb(68, 68, 68)​;​ ""&gt;​&lt;/div&gt;​
]

"Migrating from V5 to V6 of the Facebook C# SDK","<p>I'm trying to migrate from V5.3.2 to V6 of the SDK. I've got an ASP.NET 4.0 Canvas application. I noticed that now there's no more facebook.web.dll (which I previously used), and found this info:</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>>
      Removal of Facebook.Web.dll and Facebook.Web.Mvc.dll
      Starting from v6, we are depreciating Facebook.Web.dll and Facebook.Web.Mvc.dll and will no longer be providing it.
      ...
      Starting from v6, you will have to use the Facebook Javascript SDK to get the access token and pass it to the server using secure https connection or use the Facebook OAuth Login Dialog. 
      Decoding signed request (ParseSignedRequest/TryParseSignedRequest) has been moved to FacebookClient instead.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>

<pre><code>var fb = new FacebookClient();
dynamic signedRequest = fb.ParseSignedRequest(""app_secret"", Request.Params[""signed_request""]);

So that's all well and good. Previously, I had this in my code behind:</p>

<pre><code>protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
{

    var auth = new CanvasAuthorizer { Permissions = new[] { ""user_about_me"" } };

    if (auth.Authorize())
    {
        ShowFacebookContent();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>To change it, I've now got the Javascript SDK successfully loading and logging in my user:</p>

<pre><code>    &lt;div id=""fb-root""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
        FB.init({ appId: 'xxxxxxx', cookie: true, status: true, oauth: true });

        FB.getLoginStatus(function (response) {
            if (response) {
                alert(response.authResponse.accessToken);
            }
        });

&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I've tested this and it successfully logs in the user. But how do I then get it to do a postback and call the server side method that it was calling before (ShowFacebookContent)? I assume that whatever I do will have to pass the accessToken or the SignedRequest so that fb.ParseSignedRequest will work and on the server we can generate a FacebookClient.</p>

<p>I'm guessing that several people will be in a similar situation, trying to migrate off of facebook.web.dll, so any guidance would be really great.</p>

"Is it OK to allow users to query an OLTP SQL Server database with excel?","<p>I have a SQL Server 2005 database used by several applications. </p>

<p>Some users wish to query the database directly from excel. I can understand this, because it is a useful tool for ad hoc queries and then getting the data in a format that's easily transmitted and manipulated by other users.</p>

<p>My question is: Does Excel (say 2003/2007) do its querying in a way that won't cause concurrency issues?</p>

<p>Or is it done in such a way that a separate datawarehouse database needs to be made to handle this scenario?</p>

<p>I recently saw that Pagemodo gives the option to have multiple tabs on a single page as many times as you want which they call as ""UNLIMITED TABS"" in their plan options. So this means that if we want multiple welcome tabs on a page that can be done. Technically you can create only one page tab with one application. To have multiple tabs you will need multiple apps. </p>

<p>Now the question is how is it possible?</p>

<p>Even if i have multiple apps, while showing the page tab i can fetch the data about the tab from a db using ""page id"" as this is the only thing i have in the signed request. How do they get to know which page it is (ok we can get it from signed request) and which app it is out of those multiple apps that were created so that they render data accordingly?</p>

<p>I'm trying to build a DLL to be used from a Mozilla Firefox extension. I created a little C code and compiled it with GCC.</p>

<p>Here is the C code :</p>

<pre><code>#include&lt;stdio.h&gt;
int add(int a,int b)
{
    return(a+b);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here are the compilation lines:</p>

<pre><code>gcc -c library.c
gcc -shared -o library.dll library.o -Wl
</code></pre>

<p>The DLL is well compiled, I can open it with dllexp and can see the add() method exposed.</p>

<p>The problem is, when I try to use it from my extension, I always get the message: <strong>Error: couldn't open library</strong></p>

<p>Here is my Javascript call: </p>

<pre><code>var libc = ctypes.open(""C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\user32.dll""); //OK
var libc2 = ctypes.open(""C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\library.dll""); //KO
</code></pre>

<p>It seems the DLL cannot be opened by Firefox, but I wonder why. I don't see anything about building DLL for Firefox extension, it seems we can use every classic DLL library.</p>

<p>Any idea? Thanks</p>

"Any way to run Firefox with GreaseMonkey scripts without a GUI/X session","<p>I need to build a small ""monitoring"" scraper for a 3rd party website (it's an external website that has stats about our visitors).</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this website is very hard to scrape through the normal ""wget"" mechanism, because it uses a ton of sophisticated JS, part of it generated by GWT. So my workaround was to create a GreaseMonkey script and then have this script call a PHP page that would log the scraped data. Then as soon as Firefox starts with this webpage-to-scrape, the script goes to work.</p>

<p>This works well, but now I am trying to make it more robust as far as monitoring tools go. I want it to run on the server using a cron job. As far as I understand such things, this requires a DISPLAY variable to be set and for an X session to exist (Firefox is refusing to run for me). Is there any nice way to allow it to run from the batchuser account as a cron job?</p>

"open graph truncates my url","<p>I am building a simple ""x trusted y"" action for Facebook OPen Graph/</p>

<p>I have the feeling that open graph is truncating the URL I pass to it - and therefore it yields a bad user experience because when the user clicks on the link on my story.</p>

<p>Here's what happens: 
I call the function via Javascript:</p>

<pre><code>function postTrust(user_id){

    FB.api(
  'me/kweekwegg:trust',
  'post',
  {
    user: ""http://curiousbear.herokuapp.com/users/""+user_id
  },
  function(response) {

  }
);
}
</code></pre>

<p>And here are my meta tags (the rails instructions for URL returns THIS pathname so it matches the user pathname):</p>

<pre><code>&lt;head prefix=""og: http://ogp.me/ns# fb: http://ogp.me/ns/fb# kweekwegg: http://ogp.me/ns/fb/kweekwegg#""
&gt;  &lt;meta property=""fb:app_id"" content=""&lt;%= Facebook::APP_ID %&gt;"" /&gt; 
  &lt;meta property=""og:type""   content=""kweekwegg:user"" /&gt; 
  &lt;meta property=""og:url""    content= ""http://&lt;%= request.host_with_port %&gt;&lt;%= request.fullpath %&gt;"" /&gt; 
  &lt;meta property=""og:title""  content=""Ange"" /&gt; 
  &lt;meta property=""og:image""  content=""https://fbstatic-a.akamaihd.net/images/devsite/attachment_blank.png""/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>the result is that the link only goes as far as this:</p>

<pre><code>http://curiousbear.herokuapp.com/users/ [and then a bunch of FB params]
</code></pre>

<p>How can I retain the usre ID so that the person who clicks on a story link goes straight to that user's profile rather than the home page?</p>

<p>NOTE:</p>

<pre><code>if I set this up as the JS query:

    function postTrust(user_id){

        FB.api(
      'me/XXXX',
      'post',
      {
        user: ""http://curiousbear.herokuapp.com/users/4""

        //user: ""http://samples.ogp.me/371640646273751""
      },
      function(response) {

      }
    );
    }

<p>the link 'works' meaning it connects to that user (the difference being that I typed in the 4 as a consstant instead of the variable). Not very useful if I want users to change every time.</p>

"VBA Conditional Copy and Paste In Excel; Large Data Solution","<p>I have an enormous data dump that we do each month that has about 14,000 rows of data, around 12 columns wide (an entry for each month).

<p>We have a worksheet for each property. We update it each month with this data dump and then send it out to managers so that they can make forecasts for the rest of the year based on the month of data we just added.</p>

"Hot to Detect ""prevent this page from creating additional dialogs""","<h3>QUESTION</h3>

<p>How can I detect if a user has checked the box, ""prevent this page from creating additional dialogs""?</p>

<h3>WHY It's a problem</h3>

<p>If the user has prevented the appearance of confirm boxes, the function <code>confirm('foobar')</code> always returns false.</p>

<p>If the user cannot see my confirmation dialogue boxes <code>confirm('Are you sure?')</code>, then the user can never perform the action.</p>

<h3>CONTEXT</h3>

<p>So, I use the code like <code>if(confirm('are you sure?')){ //stuff... }</code>. So an auto-response of <code>false</code> from the browser will prevent the user from ever doing <code>stuff</code>. But, if there was a way to detect that the user has checked the box, then I could execute the action automatically. </p>

<p>I think that if the user has disabled the dialogues, then the function should either throw an error, or return true. The function is meant to confirm an action that the user has requested.</p>

"How to protect the 'public' part of a REST service from spam?","<p>I have a REST service that's reasonably complete and will be used with an iOS app. It's built using Ruby/Sinatra but I don't think that really matters here.</p>

<p>I'm using HTTP Basic Authentication over SSL for various endpoints and that part is working very well.</p>

<p>Question is:
How do I stop spammers etc from calling parts of the REST service that aren't protected via HTTP Basic Authentication?</p>

<p>Example: <strong>User Registration</strong></p>

<p>Let's assume the REST call is <em>(POST)</em> <strong>.../register_account</strong> passing a JSON object in the body.</p>

<p>For obvious reasons, this call cannot expect a username/password linked to a user account.</p>

<p>Ideas are:</p>

<p>1) The app has its own 'username' / password and some calls would check for app-credentials.
Problem: Rooting the device etc could unearth those credentials.</p>

<p>2) The app passes a secret token via a HTTP header to the REST Service for those calls.
Problem: Same as (1)</p>

<p>Are there any techniques commonly used out there to prevent such spam calls? I'm thinking maybe introduce the iPhone's device id in the mix but haven't identified a definite approach yet.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

"How can I establish trust in a X.509 certificate issued by an intermediary?","<p>I have an XML document that is digitally signed. I use the XML Digital Signature API to verify the signature. But this document is a SAML 2.0 Assertion that will be used for single sign-on into our web application. As such I need to establish trust in the X.509 certificate used to sign the XML document.</p>

<p>The code I am using to try and establish this trust is:</p>

<pre><code>String filename = System.getProperty(""java.home"") + ""/lib/security/cacerts"".replace('/', File.separatorChar);
FileInputStream is = new FileInputStream(filename);
KeyStore keystore = KeyStore.getInstance(KeyStore.getDefaultType());
String password = ""changeit"";
keystore.load(is, password.toCharArray());

PKIXParameters params = new PKIXParameters(keystore);
params.setRevocationEnabled(false);

CertificateFactory certFactory = CertificateFactory.getInstance(""X.509"");
CertPath certPath = certFactory.generateCertPath(Arrays.asList(signatureCertificate));

CertPathValidator certPathValidator = CertPathValidator.getInstance(CertPathValidator.getDefaultType());
CertPathValidatorResult result = certPathValidator.validate(certPath, params);

PKIXCertPathValidatorResult pkixResult = (PKIXCertPathValidatorResult) result;
TrustAnchor ta = pkixResult.getTrustAnchor();
X509Certificate cert = ta.getTrustedCert();
</code></pre>

<p>When run the call to <code>certPathValidator.validate()</code> throws a <code>CertPathValidatorException</code> with the message <code>Path does not chain with any of the trust anchors</code>.</p>

<p>Examining the certificate, it says it has been issued by <code>OU=www.verisign.com/CPS Incorp.by Ref. LIABILITY LTD.(c)97 VeriSign,OU=VeriSign International Server CA - Class 3,OU=VeriSign\, Inc.,O=VeriSign Trust Network</code>.
This is not one of the trust anchors in the JDK's cacerts key store.</p>

<p>However, using IE to inspect a similar certificate's trust chain I see that <code>www.verisign.com/CPS Incorp.</code>'s was issued by <code>VeriSign Class 3 Public Primary CA</code>, which does appear to be one of the trust anchors in the JDK's cacerts key store.</p>

"WHMCS is being hacked by {php} and Eval base64 code through tickets","<p>WHMCS uses Smarty for it's template system, though a great template system it has a flaw, the <code>{php}</code> tags. These tags allow smarty to interpret PHP code directly in the template, or in this case through the ticket system when a new ticket is created. This hack happens all the time to WHMCS systems, you can try blocking the code in WHMCS through block text option in configuration. But most of the time this doesn't work.</p>

<p>What happens is that WHMCS accepts the ticket and the hacker added the following to the ticket message:</p>

<pre><code>{php}eval(base64_decode(encoded message));{\php}
</code></pre>

<p>So smarty sees the <code>{php}</code> part and immediately let's PHP run that command. So it first decodes the PHP encoded in base64. This will bring out some PHP function/script that the hacker is trying to run.</p>

<p>Then eval takes over and actually evaluates the PHP code and runs it on server side.</p>

<p>A lot of hackers get in this way, they run codes that they know will work in WHMCS that then grab Database information and echo it to a file. Then they just grab this file through the browser URL and get the information they wanted.</p>

<p>This works on only some WHMCS install's, though WHMCS says that the most recent version doesn't allow this and {php} is disabled in Smarty, at times the hacker's do find a way to get around that and <code>eval</code> their code.</p>

"Using Excel Lookup Function and Handling Case Where No Matches Exist","<p>I'm using Excel to enter data for an event where people register.  A high percentage of the registrants will have registered for previous events, so we can their name and ID number.</p>

<p>I'm trying to use the LOOKUP function in Excel to lookup the name and then populate the ID field with their ID number.</p>

<p>This works well unless the value that is looked up is a new user that we don't already have details for.</p>

<p>However, if the LOOKUP function can not find an exact match, it chooses the largest value in the lookup_range that is less than or equal to the value.  This causes a problem since you can't tell if the match was exact (and the data is correct) or not exact and the match is incorrect.</p>

"What is the best approach for storing YouTube content appended to user contributed content?","<p>So I'm trying to implement similar functionality to Facebook where I am including information from YouTube should a users post contain a link, and when clicked it embeds the video.</p>

<p>I've accomplished it thus far, I'm just wondering how Facebook stores this information.</p>

<p>To me there are two options:</p>

<p>1) Have the post saved as normal (it is just plain text), and if the post contains a youtube link, append it on the fly in JavaScript whenever that content is <strong>viewed</strong>. However I know that when you post a link, Facebook gives you the option to change the title, description etc. Which leads me to..</p>

<p>2) Generate the HTML that would be otherwise appended when viewed and <strong>store</strong> it alongside the post at the database-insert level. </p>

<p>If so, doesnt that add a significant amount of information per post? What happens if you want to change the formatting of all youtube content within posts on your site later on? Each will be stored individually and seems like it would be a pain.</p>

"facebook iOS SDK authorization without redirect to safari","<p>I need to authorize the access to facebook within the app, because I need to store the cookies where they can be used by the app later. So I want that the autorization takes place in a webview without the need for redirecting to safari. After some research I saw some answers for this problem, which consist of changing the following line:</p>

<pre><code>[self authorizeWithFBAppAuth:YES safariAuth:YES];
</code></pre>

<p>to </p>

<pre><code>[self authorizeWithFBAppAuth:NO safariAuth:NO];
</code></pre>

<p>However, this is not working for me. It does not redirect to safari anymore, but does not open the webview either. Am I missing something? The connection with facebook works fine when redirecting to safari, so the SDK should be well installed.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>With the help of breakpoints in the FBDialog.m code, I can see that the method <code>webViewDidFinishLoad:</code>is being called, so I assume it is working as expected. However, I also add the line <code>NSLog(@""view %@"",self);</code> to the end of the <code>init</code> method in the FBDialog.m, which produces the text in the console:</p>

<p><code>view &lt;FBLoginDialog: 0x4e316f0; frame = (0 0; 0 0); autoresize = W+H; layer = &lt;CALayer: 0x4e321c0&gt;&gt;</code></p>

      &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

<p>And the javascript looks like this:</p>

"Alternative to hardcoding usernames and passwords","<p>I am writing an MVC4 app using C# Razor and all that great stuff. It has full login and password along with an extra 2 questions required before the user can login.</p>

<p>Before I enabled the login feature several months back, it was a dream, I just start the app on the page I was interested in, and it loads away allowing me to instantly see my results.</p>

<p>Occasionally I would start on the wrong page and god forbid I might have to do an extra click or two to get to the right page. I considered this bad enough.</p>

<p>Now that I have enabled the login and since done several modifications to the code, it has been through the testing department, and out to the big bad world. I am not allowed to disable it again.</p>

<p>My alternative was to essentially hardcode the testing username and password and pin with the other default values required and then remove them upon release. Thank god for testing...I actually left them hardcoded once. This was enough to teach me the lesson never to do it again.</p>

<p>However, I start my application literally without exaggeration possibly hundreds (although it feels like thousands) of times a day and every single time I have to fill in this dreaded login form. this is extremely unproductive and really uses up a lot of my time. It actively encourages me to do bad programming habits of changing several things at once and then testing. A road I don't want to start down.</p>

<p>My question: Is there an alternative to this hardcoding practice that will let me get back my productivity?</p>

<p>Please don't suggest allowing the browser to remember the details. I tried, the problem is that my app must be cross browser and platform compatible which means it not only has to run in windows browsers (which has enough variation in themselves), but also on tablets, phones and even lunix and macs. So relying on the browser to remember the details is simply not an option.</p>

<p>Any suggestions.</p>

"ColdFusion scheduled tasks - how to secure when using <cflogin>?","<p>I have a web-site written in ColdFusion that contains both the usual interactive web pages and some tasks run through the CF scheduler. The dir layout is</p>

<pre><code>/
/app
/scheduledTasks
</code></pre>

<p>I'd like the tasks to be able to use all the same settings, etc. created in the application.cfc inside of /app so I'd like to move that entire /scheduledTasks directory into /app. The problem is that that application.cfc uses the cflogin mechanism and my own log in form. The CF scheduler only lets you supply a username and password for HTTP Basic authentication. The scheduled tasks will never get past that. How can I resolve this or is there a better approach to begin with?</p>

<p>I've wondered about looking at some CGI variable in my application.cfc's OnRequestStart such as the user agent, the remote IP, and/or a magic value in the URL param's and if all are there, bypass security since I ""know"" it's CF's scheduler on the other end. This isn't great security but it may be acceptable.</p>

<p>I've also wondered about creating a new application.cfc in my root that the application.cfc in /app inherits from. I'd leave the tasks where they are and put a new application.cfc there as well that inherits common stuff from the root. This increases complexity though and I've had issues when trying to access the CFCs inside of /app/cfcs from /scheduledTasks.</p>

"Excel - Create chart from range of cells while excluding null values?","<p>I've got this Excel sheet which basically contains a lot of data.
Now, this Excel sheet is updated dynamically via a macro that imports the data. So the data might change, meaning, some cells might be populated, while others won't.</p>

<pre><code>=IF(Sheet1!E2&lt;&gt;0;Sheet1!A2;"""")

<p>This is repeated until row 60.</p>

<p>Now, what I want to do is to select the range A2:A60 and insert that data to a chart. But the thing is, the chart adds the cells that doesn't have a value. I want to exclude it from the chart without having to change the range of the chart. Is this possible using a formula in the Chart selection? Or would I have to use a macro?</p>

<p>Edit: Right now, the chart looks like this when I create it based on A2:A60. Notice that only A4:A17 actually have any value, the other ones have nothing, because of the formula described above. </p>

First 10 slides of <a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/&#90;endCon/lesser-known-security-problems-in-php-applications-presentation"" rel=""nofollow"">this talk</a> give examples (whole talk is great). <a href=""http://www.hardened-php.net/advisory_072006.130.html"" rel=""nofollow"">phpMyAdmin exploit</a> example of CSRF attack.</p>

<p><strong>Example countermeasures:</strong> Reconfigure <code>$_REQUEST</code> array merge-order from  <code>GPC</code> to <code>CGP</code> so GET/POST overwrite COOKIE, not the other way around. Use <a href=""http://www.hardened-php.net/suhosin/"" rel=""nofollow"">Suhosin</a> to block overwrite of superglobals.</p>

<p>(Also, wouldn't be asking if I thought my question was a dupe, but happily the overwhelming SO answer to <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/107683/when-and-why-should-request-be-used-instead-of-get-post-cookie"">""When and why should $_REQUEST be used instead of $_GET / $_POST / $_COOKIE?""</a> was ""Never."")</p>

"Facebook sdk login crashes app on Kindle Fire emulator","<p>My app has no functionality without Facebook integration, so the very first thing my app does in onCreate is log into Facebook, providing it with a listener that will grab the user's news feed and then load it into my app. However, on the Kindle Fire emulator, my app can't even open the login dialog for Facebook, using the authorize call from the SDK.</p>

<p>This login as well as the rest of my app runs flawlessly for me on several test devices, and every AVD emulator that I have created except the official Kindle Fire emulator that I installed from the SDK manager. I sadly don't have access to a Kindle Fire, so I can't test it on a real device.</p>

<p>In an effort to isolate the problem, I temporarily modified my code to do absolutely nothing in the callback listener, I just leave an empty void method for my onDataLoaded() implementation. In onCreate, I am calling the following:</p>

<pre><code>        m_fbHelper.authorize(new NFDataLoadedListener() {

        public void onDataLoaded() {
            // TODO Auto-generated method stub

        }
    }, this);
</code></pre>

<p>The definition in the FbHelper Class is:</p>

<pre><code>public void authorize(NFDataLoadedListener dataLoadedListener, Home homeActivity){
        m_facebook.authorize(homeActivity, s_permissions, new  FacebookDataRetrievalListener(dataLoadedListener));
}
</code></pre>

<p>When the activity is created and this call is made, a notification box appears that says ""loading,"" which usually happens when logging in. Then the app just crashes and the emulator goes back to the home screen.</p>

<p>The log says this:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Since there is no stack trace, I can't figure out why the Facebook SDK failed to bring up the login dialog. Other SO posts say that these log messages indicate a memory leak, but I haven't done anything in the app yet besides try to log into Facebook, so it must be an SDK problem if it is a memory leak. </p>

"Staging and Development Server Accessibility Restrictions","<p>I have some staging and development web servers on cloud hosting. I do not want them to be accessible to the general public. It's easy enough to restrict access by network or authentication. </p>

<p>The problem is that there are many times where I want third parties to have access, so they can preview changes before they go into production. It would be too much to ask these third parties to configure VPN clients or to create user accounts for all of them. It's ok if it's a little bit less convenient than just sending them a link in an e-mail, but too much would be a problem. </p>

"Sensibility of using generic client keys with openvpn in this scenario","<p>I have configured a working openvpn server (ubuntu 10.04) and client, no problems.</p>

<p>I generated certificates and key files and such like for a client machine.</p>

<p>We deploy a number of these generic client machines for data capture, anywhere between 10 and 20 a month. The reason for the VPN is to allow us to remote login for occasional support and monitoring. They send their data home via other means (not the VPN)</p>

<p>I am considering making the client config files generic and using them on all deployed machines (the ""duplicate-cn"" option on the server side).</p>

<p>My reasoning is this:</p>

<ol>
<li>The vpn server explicitly disallows ssh login from anywhere except our office, so a connected client cannot ssh into the server</li>
<li>In addition, login to the openvpn server requires the X509 .pem keyfile (it's an Amazon EC2 instance)</li>
<li>The server does not allow clients to see each other (""client-to-client"" is commented out), and there is no access to any other networks, it's purely so we can ssh in to the client.</li>
<li>We are lazy, and don't want to admin generating the certs, applying them to the machine (hence no longer generic and no longer hot swappable etc) and people will get confused and get this wrong.</li>
</ol>

<p>The main drawback seems to be:</p>

<ol>
<li>It's difficult to tell which machine is which where there are many connections (I haven't found a solution for this yet)</li>
</ol>

<p>The client machines are installed on ""untrusted"" sites, that is, I cannot guarantee their phyiscal security.</p>

<p>So my question is... what is the worst that could happen in this scenario? If a machine got compromised directly, the worst it could do is open a VPN tunnel (which it does automatically anyway!) but then could not really get anywhere beyond that. We could just block that IP at the firewall level once detected.</p>

<p>Is my thought process correct here or have I missed anything?</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>I maybe should have said that the client machines are headless (no video/keyboard) and not accessed directly by the client sites (although you cannot outright guarantee that!). This is a machine-2-machine (M2M) environment. These are not (eg) laptops carried by sales folks.</p>

<p><strong>Could you recommend an addon for Firefox which is more efficient than having all these windows, tabs and browsers open constantly?</strong></p>

"authlogic connect tutorial","<p>I am trying to add the facebook connect to an existing site in rails 3 that uses authlogic.
so that  existing users can sign in via their facebook account (I'll find existing account via email id in facebook ) and new users can sign up using facebook too.</p>

<p>I am trying to use authlogic connect
( I found other alternative like omniauth , facebooker2 etc , omniauth plays well with devise but I dont want to move to devise &amp; it seems only authlogic connect plays well with authlogic and rails3 )</p>

<p>But I am unable to find some proper tutorial where I could understand how to use it.</p>

<p>I looked at their project site :</p>

<p><a href=""https://github.com/viatropos/authlogic-connect"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/viatropos/authlogic-connect</a></p>

<p>I used the little help on their site and tried to do a little.
Now when the facebook login button is clicked it goes to facebook page asks for all the permission and then it comes back to a url with code as a paramater. what do I do with the code param ?</p>

<p>Can someone suggest me a proper tutorial (not example) for using the authlogic connect</p>

"How to retrieve all occurences of a particular value within a string?","<p>I'm looking at an excel work-book with potential definitions for a column(upto 135) referenced from an adjacent sheet.</p>

<p><strike>E.g. Sheet 1: Col C (values 0-134 defined in Sheet 2 )</strike></p>

<p><strike>E.g. 0,1,8 Each row in Col C Sheet 1 may have any combination of the values separated by commas. </strike></p>

<p>Imagine a workbook with two sheets named 'Student', and 'Team names'
Each row in the sheet 'Team names' lists the ID of a team. A student may play on more than one team. </p>

<p>Say there are 3 teams they would appear on Sheet '<em>Team names</em>' as </p>

<p>A1=10 </p>

<p>A2 = 20</p>

<p>A3=30.</p>

<p>Say now that there are 4 students whose roll.no appears on Sheet '<em>Student</em>' as A1 = 13, A2=27, A3=43, A4=53.</p>

<p>Roll.No 13 <strong>Col B</strong> 10, 20, 30</p>

<p>Roll.No 27 <strong>Col B</strong> 30, 10</p>

<p>Roll.No 53 <strong>Col B</strong> 20</p>

<p>Roll.No 43 <strong>Col B</strong> 30, 20</p>

<p>The intent here is to setup a formula such that in the sheet 'Team names' </p>

<p>10 <strong>Col B</strong> 2 </p>

<p>20 <strong>Col B</strong> 3</p>

<p>30 <strong>Col B</strong> 3</p>

<p>Sheet 2 must maintain statistics of the occurence of each value. This is done using COUNTIF. The issue here is that COUNTIF doesn't handle an embedded value too well. When so done, the reference to '1' in the above example won't appear.</p>

<p>How can this be done without resorting to a sub-routine?</p>

"Secure connection to MySQL with VPN?","<p>I have a VPS with MySQL 5.5, which is listening only on localhost because of obvious security reasons. I have set up VPN connection from my own machine to that VPS and I connect successfully. </p>

<p>What would be the best way to grant same access to all MySQL databases to anyone connected to the VPN as if it was a localhost request?</p>

<p>I might be asking this question in rather silly way, so if you don't get my idea, I will elaborate.</p>

<p>edit:
The VPS is Linux (Cent OS 5.6), if that helps. MySQL is listening on 3306. I have currently forwarded all connections that come from my IP to port  3306 on the public address of the machine to 127.0.0.1:3306. But this is not very convenient, as I tend to travel and when I'm not at home, this method fails.</p>

"How to refresh data in a template","<p>I use a reporting system that outputs data to two spreadsheets - one is the report parameters, the other the report data (as a list).</p>

<p>For one of these reports, I created four pivot tables (each on their own tab) and saved the workbook as a template (.xlt). When saving, I selected the option to refresh data every time the template is opened.</p>

<p>My understanding is that when my report has been created I can right click on one of the tabs and 'Insert...', then choose my template. The two tabs that are in the report, I thought, would then replace the data already in the template (they have the same names) but Excel is just adding the tabs from the template with the suffix '(1)' and keeping the dummy data that was saved in the template.</p>

<p>I'm guessing that I am doing something wrong, but can anyone explain what please?</p>

"Dynamic Code Generation and security","<p>I encounter a problem with the <code>JSON.Net</code> serialization library and I wanted opinion of people more expert than me in CAS and AppDomain management.</p>

<p>To have more information on the problem, you can refer to the <a href=""http://json.codeplex.com/workitem/21575"" rel=""nofollow"">issue 21575</a>. I submitted <a href=""http://www.codeplex.com/Download?ProjectName=json&amp;DownloadId=286759"" rel=""nofollow"">a patch</a> for this issue.</p>

<p>The idea is that <code>DynamicCodeGeneration</code> flag is statically set once and for all in the current application domain when you first access it. However, I think that permission allowed for an application domain can change.</p>

<p>For example, if you call a method of an object in an application domain, across another application domain, it seems that <strong>you inherit of the permissions of the most restrictive application domain</strong>. So for me this assumption that permissions won't change for an application domain and that you can statically set <code>DynamicCodeGeneration</code> once and for all is wrong.</p>

<p>Am I correct ? Or do I miss something about CAS and AppDomain management ?</p>

"Any Html control libraries - a visual counterpart to jQuery/Prototype","<p>jQuery provides a browser neutral library for accessing and manipulating the DOM. This is good.</p>

<p>However I'm looking for a counterpart for the visual side of things - I need to build pixel measured interfaces, without wasting so much time testing and correcting cross browser issues (buttons having crazy margins in IE, or using the wrong box model in FireFox. The many IE and otherwise instances where putting several elements on one line screws up alignment or floats).</p>

<p>Basically I need to be able to plan out interfaces on paper with exact pixel dimensions (for example all textboxes should be exactly 22px high), and then easily translate those designs into Html. In a WinForms world, this is usually straight forward. With html it's anything but, and I find it's worst when it comes to input controls.</p>

<p>What libraries or collections could I use to make this sort of design a reality (outside of just converting everything into Silverlight where that degree of control exists). Javascript is required to be on (AJAX to begin with), so libraries can depend on it entirely for controls.</p>

<p>Some of the components I'm looking for in a uniform style with precise pixel control</p>

<p>Buttons<br />
Textboxes<br />
Dropdowns<br />
ComboBoxes (Dropdown whose text can be edited directly)<br />

"Excel pivot table calculated field total returns unexpected value","<p>I have an Excel spreadsheet which has a pivot table on it. The data itself is quite simple, Number of Units and a Discount (percentage from 0 to 100), pivoted on date across the top and customer down the left hand side. Those numbers are straight from a SQL view, so the pivot table source is just:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM UnitDiscountView
</code></pre>

<p>All was looking fine until I attempted to add a calculated field of TotalCost (Each unit will costs £200) to the pivot table:</p>

<pre><code>= (200 *NrUnits ) * ((100-Discount)/100)
</code></pre>

<p>The total at the bottom was negative, and vastly more than I was expecting as a number. If I select all the cells, then the sum which appear in the status bar at the bottom is what I would expect, but the Total field at the bottom is over a hundred times bigger, and negative to boot.</p>

<p>I am stumped. I have searched since Friday without finding anything which will help me to solve this. Any pointers on where to start looking for the solution would be greatly appreciated. I should mention that SQL is my forte, not Excel. I haven't used Excel's Pivot tables before last week, so I am probably missing something really obvious.</p>

"Facebook Connect & HTTP Cookies - How Can I Overcome this ""Race Condition""","<p>If you're wondering what the ""Race Condition"" is, its a flaw in a system whereas it's highly dependent on timing. See the wiki <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_condition"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a> for more info.</p>

<p>So, the condition i have is relating to Facebook Connect and implementing a Single-Sign-On service with an ASP.NET 4.0 Web Application (Forms Based Authentication - IIS7).</p>

<p>The process itself (including Logout) is working nicely, but.....</p>

<p>Here's scenario where it's not exactly working 100%:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li>User logs into Facebook.</li>
  <li>User navigates to my website.</li>
  <li>User is not logged in automatically (should be though).</li>
  <li>User refreshes the page, and is logged in automatically.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>When i breakpoint the code in step 3 - the Facebook Cookies are not yet there (in the <code>HttpContext.Current.Request.Cookies</code>).</p>

<p>But when the page is reloaded (step 4) - the Facebook Cookies are there.</p>

<p>To me, it could be a number of things:</p>

<p>I'm not sure if its just a case of Facebook has not <strong>yet</strong> granted access to my application to access the cookies (delay in cross-domain handshake - xd_receiver.htm), or  an issue with cross-domain cookies itself and the ASP.NET Page lifecycle.</p>

<p>Anyone else dealt with this problem?</p>

<p>It's not the ""be-all-and-end-all"", but it's annoying (and not great from a user perspective).</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>Ok ive noticed something strange now. If i log into Facebook (via Facebook), and wait say 20 seconds, then go to my website, it STILL does not log me in. Only after the second load does it log me in. So maybe its not a timing issue - why does it need 2 refreshes to be able to read the cookies?</p>

<p>To clear up some confusion - Facebook sets the cookies (that the user is logged into Facebook), and my website reads these cookies.</p>

<p>This happens on every page request (logic in a user control which is on every single page)</p>

<pre><code>protected void Page_PreRender(object sender, EventArgs eventArgs)
{
   if (FacebookUser.IsAuthenticated) // static property, checks HttpContext.Request.Cookies
   {
        // log them into my website
   }
}
</code></pre>

<p>So, on first refresh - there is nothing in HttpContext.Request.Cookies.</p>

<p>On second refresh, they are there.</p>

<p>I think the reason for this is because the FB.Init is executed on the client-side on every page request. This is what initializes the cookies. So when you first go to my website (after logging into Facebook), on the server side (where i check the cookies), this function has not yet been run. </p>

<p>So i think im fighting a losing battle here (trying to access a cookie server-side, that is set client-side).</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 2:</strong></p>

<p>Here's my init code (run on window.load):</p>

<pre><code>FB.init('myapikey', 'xd_receiver.htm', null);
</code></pre>

<p>I'm now trying to do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>FB.init('myapikey', 'xd_receiver.htm', null);
FB.getLoginStatus(function(response) {
  if (!response.session) {
      return false;
  }
  else {
    window.location.reload();
  }
});
</code></pre>

<p>But am getting a JavaScript error - ""FB.getLoginStatus"" is not a function. =(</p>

<p>This is because im using the following JavaScript library:
<a href=""http://static.ak.connect.facebook.com/js/api_lib/v0.4/FeatureLoader.js.php/en_US"" rel=""nofollow"">http://static.ak.connect.facebook.com/js/api_lib/v0.4/FeatureLoader.js.php/en_US</a></p>

<p>Whereas other people say to use this one:
<a href=""http://connect.facebook.net/en_US/all.js"" rel=""nofollow"">http://connect.facebook.net/en_US/all.js</a></p>

<p>I was looking at the doco for the new JS API.</p>

<p>For reference to other's who stumble to this thread, here is the doco for the 'old' JS API:
<a href=""http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/oldjavascript/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/oldjavascript/</a></p>

<p>So i've got this problem solved by using FB.Connect.get_status() and a window reload if the user is authenticated.</p>

<p>Thanks for everyone's help.</p>

<p>This is my ""solution"" to the problem if anyone else cares:</p>

<pre><code>window.onload = function() { 
                FB.init('{0}', 'xd_receiver.htm');
                FB.ensureInit(function() {
                   FB.Connect.ifUserConnected(onUserConnected, onUserNotConnected); 
                });
            };

            function onUserConnected() {
                alert('connected!');
                window.location.reload();
            }

            function onUserNotConnected() {
                alert('not connected');
            }
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, you should check the Forms Authentication cookie before doing window.location.reload(), otherwise the page will just keep refreshing. =)</p>

When I click on the login with facebook it redirects me to facebook login and I put the credentials then submit it, but when I get redirected to the controller method which is supposed to redirect to my website home, I get an internal server error (even though the script seems to run since I can see that the session variables have been created). And the weird thing is, that it is working fine on my development environment (localhost). Any ideas? Is it a file permission issue, or PHP installation issue (Other features are working fine ). </p>

<p>Thanks in advance</p>

"Excel macro - Copy until the last piece of data","<p>Is it possible to select a range to copy to the last item?</p>

<pre><code>Sheets(""Design"").Select
Range(""A1:C200"").Copy

'My data only runs until E48 and Im left with 152 blancs.
</code></pre>

<p>So now it copies from A1 to E200, but how can I edit the above code so it only selects until the last piece of data, which in my case is E48? (this is variable)</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>@Jean</p>

<p>In my excel sheet I have data running from A1-A18, B is empty and C1-C2. Now I would like to copy all the cells that contain a value. </p>

<pre><code> With Range(""A1"")
     Range(.Cells(1, 1), .End(xlDown).Cells(20, 3)).Copy
 End With
</code></pre>

<p>This will copy everything from A1-C20, but I only want A1-A18 and C1-C2 seen as though these contain data. But it needs to be formed in a way that once I have data in B or my range extends, that these get copied too.</p>

<p>Is this perhaps a bit clearer?</p>

<p>About the Copy/Paste situation;</p>

<p>I currently paste using this</p>

<pre><code>appWD.Selection.PasteSpecial ' So it copies the formats too?
'In your case, do you mean I should do it like this?
Range(.Cells(1, 1), .End(xlDown).Cells(20, 3)).Copy Destination:=appWD.Selection.PasteSpecial

"How secure is file_get_contents with GET parameters over https://","<p>I'm using ""file_get_contents"" in the following way:</p>

<p>(the script below is posted on, for example <a href=""https://siteA.com/checkifvalid.php"" rel=""nofollow"">https://siteA.com/checkifvalid.php</a> ...notice the URL is httpS)</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
//there is a login form on this URL and the entries put in the form are used to set the username &amp; password variables below.
$username = ""someusername"";
$password = ""somepassword"";
$secretkey = ""slkd89087235"";

$yesorno = file_get_contents(""httpS://siteB.com/checkdatabase.php?username=$username&amp;password=$password&amp;secretkey=$secretkey"");

if ($yesorno == 'yes') {
//details are valid, so something 
} else {
//details aren't valid, display they aren't valid
}
?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The ""checkdatabase.php"" script gets the username &amp; password using _GET and grabs the variables from the URL and then cross references those login details to see if they are valid or not.  If they are, it echos ""yes"" if not, it echos ""no"".</p>

<p>The checkdatabase.php script is set to only run if both the username, password &amp; secret key parameters have been passed, and then only if the secret key value that has been passed matches the secret key stored within that php script.</p>

<p>There will also be a limit to the number of times ""<a href=""http://siteA.com/checkifvalid.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://siteA.com/checkifvalid.php</a>"" can be entered in a given span of time to prevent a type of ""brute force"" attack guessing user/pass combos.</p>

<p>My question is, how secure is the above method seeing as both URLs are using httpS?</p>

<p>Should I encrypt the values sent?  Or is what is above secure already?</p>

"Facebook php SDK /me/feed posting link and not have the link go through the app, but straight to the page","<p>Built a custom app that will allow users to add jobs to a system. Once they've done that, it should post to their profile pages as well as their news feed. All of this is working perfect, except for one bit. If somebody else clicks on that link, let's say a friend of the person who has posted the link (from the system when adding a job) they're asked to install the app.</p>

<p>What should happen is a new tab should open with that position showing. If you use facebook like / recommend, this works, but requires the user to do it manually. When using the custom facebook app to do it via /user_id/feed, POST it shows the link and everything working fine, till one of their friends clicks on the link and is then requested to install the app.</p>

<p>How can I make so that the link being posted on the fan page, profile page of the user who has given permission to the app to do so, to just open in a new tab and go directly to the link that was posted instead of routing through the app?</p>

<p>Just to add on to this, the url that get's created via the app looks like this : http://www.facebook.com/connect/uiserver.php?app_id=142332219213134&amp;method=permissions.request&amp;redirect_uri=[the actual url being passed]&amp;response_type=code&amp;display=async&amp;auth_referral=1</p>

<p>This makes that you HAVE to install the app to view the links... which should not happen, you should just be taken straight to the link that was shared via the app.</p>

"How can I link to the page of a specific Facebook newsfeed post (in the application or browser)?","<p>In my Android app, I log in using the Facebook SDK and display posts from the users' newsfeed. I want to give them the option to comment or like a post, but I don't want to implement that. So, my solution is to allow the user to click on the post, which will then load the post page in either the official Facebook App, or just the mobile facebook website. Either way is fine for me. </p>

<p>I googled around and was not able to find a suitable way to deliver an intent to launch the Facebook app to a specific post page. So, I decided to try to launch the browser and navigate to the mobile Facebook website to the specific post. I build the url string using information about the current user, the id of the post, and the id of the friend it belongs to. This url is exactly the same url I see when I browse to the page in my browser from my newsfeed. Like so:</p>

<pre><code>                String url = ""http://m.facebook.com/#!/story.php?story_fbid="" + postId + ""&amp;id="" + friendId + ""&amp;_user="" + FBHelper.getCurrentUserId();
                Uri uri = Uri.parse(url);

                Intent intent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW, uri);

                startActivity(intent);
</code></pre>

<p>However, when the browser loads, I get a page that says ""Sorry, something went wrong. We're working on getting this fixed as soon as we can."" I have tried both touch.facebook.com and m.facebook.com. </p>

<p>I am looking for any solution that will either allow me to open the mobile site to the chosen post, or to launch the Facebook app to the chosen post activity. </p>

"To merge or not to merge? Facebook account and regular site account","<p>I am building a web service that will allow users to register either by creating a 'regular' account (username / password) or by using their facebook login (facebook connect)</p>

<p>If a user registers with facebook, they will get an account created on my site.</p>

<p>If a user registers the normal way (username / pass) they will also get an account.</p>

<p>What I would like to do is somehow merge these accounts if they have the same email address. 
Is this viable or should I leave them as separate accounts?</p>

<p>The reason for merging is that I don't want users to have several accounts per email address
Does anyone else create accounts on their sites via facebook and regular accounts? If so, what logic do you apply for handling these two different types accounts?</p>

<p>UPDATE </p>

<p>I guess my question is, if a regular account has the same email address as a facebook account. Am I safe to merge the accounts? Or can I not trust the email the user has associated with their facebook account? –</p>

<p>I installed windows 7 and the system recommended me the maximum resolution (1280x1024) which made windows looks great but texts were too small. So I changed to big the text in the win-7 init tasks but not all the programs are using this size. For instance Firefox has a very small text and specially samll images due to a high resolution. I know I can use ctlr + + to increase it, but I can't change it in other programs and it is a little bit annoying to change it on every start. If I change to a lower resolution (the lower one which keeps the ratio aspect is 1024x748) everything looks a little bit blurry.</p>

<p>So my question is how have you configured your resolution (which value) and font size to see the text and images in a properly size in a similar screen and windows 7.</p>

"Is there any way to have persistent (regardless of how small) client-side storage via the web?","<h2>Okay, since none of you guys like my question, let me rephrase it.</h2>

<p>User logs into an HTML form.  With JavaScript, their password is hashed locally (salted too).  The server knows what the password + salt should be, user is already registered, blahblahblah.  Now the user requests a page.  The server sends a random ID to the user.  When the user loads the next page, this random ID is appended to the key they have locally stored, it's hashed, and THAT is sent to the server.  The server knows what they key is and the random ID, performs the same hash, and compares.  If they match, congrats, it came from the proper computer.  If not, then someone's been sniffing your TCP/IP traffic.</p>

<p>All of this is obviously <em>without</em> SSL, otherwise this would be highly redundant.</p>

<p>My question - HOW DO I STORE THE KEY ON A CLIENT PC?</p>

<h2>Original Post:</h2>

<p>Hello;</p>

<p>I'm working on developing a PHP Content Management System, and came up with a secure login system.  The only problem is that it would require some form of client-side storage (for a very small key, 40 characters in length) - otherwise the user would have to type in their password on every page load.</p>

<p>Is there a way that, using either PHP or JavaScript, I can store a small 40-character string on a client's PC an retrieve it later?</p>

<p>EDIT: COOKIES ARE NOT AN OPTION.  This 40-character string can NOT leave the client's computer, and all set cookies are sent with each HTTP header.</p>

<p>I REPEAT - <em>COOKIES ARE INSECURE AND NOT A VIABLE OPTION FOR THIS.</em></p>

<p>Let me rework it like this - client submits an HTTP form.  With some scripting language (e.g. JavaScript), the password is stripped from the form, NOT sent to the server, encrypted, and is kept CLIENT-SIDE, which I can retrieve and verify (by hashing it with a key sent to the user from the server).  This verification is sent to the server, <em>never the key</em>.</p>

<p>As seen from the above array the key 1 contains array of headings of the sheet.
So in all there are 7 columns in an excel sheet.
Currently if any of the cell contains no value in sheet then it skips those values in an array
but my requirement is that if a cell contains no values in that case the array should be containing blank values.</p>

<p>In plugin this whole array creation process takes place in below function</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>function _parsesheet($spos)</p>

"Facebook 'Feed' dialog 'name' link not working","<p>Here is my working code that successfully displays the Facebook 'Feed' dialog in a new window:</p>

        + ""&amp;redirect_uri=http://www.thesite.com"");'""&gt;Share on Facebook&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This successfully displays the Feed dialog in a new window.</p>

<p>Notice the '&amp;name' parameter in the code above  -- on the Feed dialog it displays as:  <strong>Please respond to the link</strong>.</p>

<p>BUT if you click on it -- it does nothing, as if it's not a link.  But it is, in fact, a link.</p>

<p>The '<strong>Please respond to the link</strong>' looks like a link -- it is in a bold font and the letters are blue, while the other params -- the <em>'caption'</em> param which displays on the Feed dialog as 'Just Work', and the <em>'description'</em> param which displays as 'Comeon work' -- those are not in a bold font nor are they in blue color.  Just regular text, those two params.</p>

<p>So with my Feed dialog box open,  I right-clicked on the <strong>Please respond to the link</strong>  and selected 'Open link in a new window' and Firefox opens a new browser and the URL bar has the <em>http://www.thesite.com</em> which, as you notice, is how I set my &amp;link parameter in the above code.  In other words -- Firefox has no problem navigating with the URL connected to my &amp;name parameter.</p>

<p>Next, I checked and made sure Firefox was not blocking popups.  It wasn't.</p>

<p>I don't undersand why my ""<strong>Please respond to the link</strong>"" feed dialog  <em>&amp;name</em> parameter:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>looks like a clickable link on the Feed Dialog box</p></li>
<li><p>and upon being right-clicked, it can be opened in a new browser -- and navigates to the <em>&amp;link</em> parameter successfully</p></li>
<li><p>and yet does NOT do anything if you click on <strong>Please respond to the link</strong> on the Feed dialog.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Am I missing something in my Feed dialog code above?  </p>

<p>What is the purpose of the <em>&amp;name</em> parameter on that Feed dialog box?</p>

<p>Or what's the point of having the <strong>&amp;link</strong> and <strong>&amp;name</strong> paramaters appear to be a link on the Feed dialog but then NOT work when clicked on?</p>

"Unknown and strange RDP successful logins in EventViewer","<p>I have a Windows Server 2008 R2 with a valid IP, and recently I've found hundreds of unknown and strange RDP successful logins logged in EventViewer. Here are some details:</p>

<ol>
<li>They are not similar to normal logins, they happen like every second in a while even when I myself am logged in to the server.</li>
<li>Event reads ""Remote Desktop Services: User authentication succeeded"" in ""Microsoft-Windows-TerminalServices-RemoteConnectionManager/Operational"", Event ID 1149</li>
<li>They seem to use some random user accounts without a domain name. I'm pretty sure that I don't have those local user accounts, and the server doesn't belong to any domain. Legitimate RDP logins have a valid user account and workgroup name, but those logins use unknown user names without any workgroup.</li>
</ol>

<p>Support staff couldn't help me and I'm very curious what are these strange logins. Are they some sort of brute force attack? so why does it read ""Successful""? Am I being hacked? Why do they keep happening continually? </p>

<p>EDIT: I like to point out again that these accounts DO NOT EXIST on the server. I wonder why should there be a successful RDP login from a user account which does not exist. (e.g. has no user profile folder)</p>

"element.firstChild is returning '<TextNode ...' instead of an Object in FF","<p>I wrote a tab system using some very basic Javascript and it runs like a champ in IE 8 but, in FireFox 3 I am coming up short.  The pertitent HTML is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>            &lt;div id=""tabs""&gt;
                &lt;ul class=""tabs""&gt;
                    &lt;li class=""current""&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;span&gt;News&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

                    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;span&gt;Twitter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;/ul&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Then, on page load, I get dropped into this method:</p>

<pre><code>function processTabs(TabContainer, PageContainer, Index) {
var tabContainer = document.getElementById(TabContainer);
var tabs = tabContainer.firstChild;

var tab = tabs.firstChild;
var i = 0;
.... more code }
</code></pre>

<p>The rest of the code does not matter at this point because it never gets called.  tabContainer is set properly to reference the div with the ID tabs. Now, in Internet Explorer when I call tabContainer.firstChild the variable 'tabs' is referencing my UL and then the call var tab = tabs.firstChild; references my first LI.   The problem is that when I call tabContainer.firstChild Venkman is telling me it is returning .  So firefox is reading my newlines as actual children inside the div's! My UL is actually the second child in the childNodes collection!</p>

<p>Is there any way to fix this?</p>

<p>The second column (""days"") represents days elapsed since the signup date and the retention is based on that day and the signup_date (since retention can change over time). I need to make projections going forward, and unfortunately for me (since I would prefer to do this programmatically), my boss wants them in Excel. So I'm trying to use the Lookup() function to find the most recent value in the retention column that would match the ""days"" elapsed from a certain signup date.</p>

<p>Anyway, that's all prelude to the question, which is that right now if I enter the formula:</p>

<pre><code>=lookup(1,B:B,C:C)
</code></pre>

<p>where B:B is ""days"" and C:C is retention, it doesn't necessarily return the first (i.e. most recent) retention value in the data set. For example, in this case, I need the cell to be 0.4855, but the formula may give me 0.4727 (which is the second ""days=1"" row). Is there any way to configure it to do this or is there another function that will do what I need?</p>

<p>The function runs with no errors, but the ability to change the time manually in Windows 7 is still enabled. I think this is because I'm setting privileges for the current process (my program) and not the current user. Is there a way to get an access token for the currently logged in user, or should I be getting the token for the date/time control panel, or is there another way entirely I should be approaching this? </p>

<p>Again, the goal is for the Win7 logged-in user to not be able to change the system time.

Firefox will trigger the event for the link that changes the hash part (only the first time though if the hash link is the same), and won't trigger it at all if I click on the Yahoo link and then click the back button.</p>

<p>So is there a way that I can tell in Firefox that a user has just clicked back and landed back on my page from a completely different site on a different domain? Is there another event that would work for this purpose in Firefox? (The load event does not get triggered either when I go back from yahoo.com.)</p>

In this way, the method fbDidLogin is never called, neither the method fbDidNotLogin.</p>

<p>I don't know if it is the proper way, if there is a better way, please let me know.</p>

"What is the best Distributed Brute Force countermeasure?","<p>First, a little background: It is no secret that I am implementing an auth+auth system for CodeIgniter, and so far I'm winning (so to speak). But I've run into a pretty non-trivial challenge (one that most auth libraries miss entirely, but I insist on handling it properly): how to deal intelligently with <strong>large-scale, distributed, variable-username brute-force attacks</strong>.</p>

<p>I know all the usual tricks:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Limiting # of failed attempts per IP/host</strong> and denying the offenders access (e.g. Fail2Ban) - which no longer works <a href=""http://www.christopher-kunz.de/archives/205-Distributed-and-coordinated-SSH-bruteforce-attacks.html"">since botnets have grown smarter</a></li>
<li>Combining the above with a <strong>blacklist of known 'bad' IPs/hosts</strong> (e.g. DenyHosts) - which relies on botnets falling for #1, <a href=""http://www.christopher-kunz.de/archives/205-Distributed-and-coordinated-SSH-bruteforce-attacks.html"">which they increasingly don't</a></li>
<li><strong>IP/host whitelists</strong> combined with traditional auth (sadly useless with dynamic IP users and the high churn on most web sites)</li>
<li>Setting a <strong>sitewide limit</strong> on # of failed attempts within a N minute/hour period, and throttling (suspending) all login attempts after that for a number of minutes/hours (with the problem that DoS attacking you becomes botnet child's play)</li>
<li>Mandatory <strong>digital signatures</strong> (public-key certificates) or RSA hardware tokens for all users with NO login/password option (without question a rock-solid solution, but only practical for closed, dedicated services)</li>
<li>Enforced <strong>ultra-strong password schemes</strong> (e.g. >25 nonsense characters with symbols - again, too impractical for casual users)</li>
<li>And finally, <strong>CAPTCHAs</strong> (which could work in most cases, but are annoying for users and <a href=""http://caca.zoy.org/wiki/PWNtcha"">virtually useless</a> against a <a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/valicac/captcha"">determined, resourceful attacker</a>)</li>
</ol>

<p>Now, these are just the theoretically workable ideas. There are <em>plenty</em> of rubbish ideas that blow the site wide open (e.g. to trivial DoS attacks). What I want is something better. And by better, I mean:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>It has to be secure(+) against DoS and brute-force attacks, and not introduce any new vulnerabilities that might allow a slightly sneakier bot to continue operating under the radar</p></li>
<li><p>It has to be automated. If it requires a human operator to verify each login or monitor suspicious activity, it's not going to work in a real-world scenario</p></li>
<li><p>It has to be feasible for mainstream web use (ie. high churn, high volume, and open registration that can be performed by non-programmers)</p></li>
<li><p>It can't impede the user experience to the point where casual users will get annoyed or frustrated (and potentially abandon the site)</p></li>
<li><p>It can't involve kittens, unless they are <em>really really secure</em> kittens</p></li>
</ul>

<p>(+) <em>By 'secure', I mean at least as secure as a paranoid user's ability to keep his password secret</em></p>

<p>So - let's hear it! <em>How would you do it</em>? Do you know of a best-practice that I haven't mentioned (oh please say you do)? I admit I do have an idea of my own (combining ideas from 3 and 4), but I'll let the true experts speak before embarrassing myself ;-)</p>

"400 Bad request when uploading a file from Firefox 11, Mac OSX","<p>I have a problem that seems to manifest itself only on Mac OSX, and only on the Firefox browser (granted, I've only tried Safari and Chrome besides Firefox).</p>

<p>The problem is that <strong>file uploads seem to not work properly for Firefox on OSX</strong>. Only authenticated users are allowed to upload files, and all authenticated users <strong>run under SSL</strong>.</p>

<p>The server is Apache2, running on Ubuntu server:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Linux www1 2.6.32-24-server #39-Ubuntu SMP Wed Jul 28 06:21:40 UTC 2010 x86_64 GNU/Linux</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, in my <code>error-ssl.log</code>-file, I get an entry like the following when a user tries to upload a file under these conditions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[Sat Mar 24 12:57:53 2012] [error] [client xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx] request
  failed: error reading the headers, referer: {some-page}</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The corresponding request in <code>access-ssl.log</code> looks like the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx - - [24/Mar/2012:12:57:40 +0100] ""POST /attachment/upload HTTP/1.1"" 400 734<br />

</blockquote>

<p>Now, I'm a bit stumped how I'm supposed to tackle this. I don't have a Mac myself (though we have a few at the office, but without any developer tools installed), and for all other browsers, as well as all browsers on Windows, it seems to work just fine. </p>

<ul>
<li>Any ideas of what can be done?</li>
<li>Could it be an SSL issue?</li>
</ul>

<p>If you need any more information regarding the server config etc, tell me what you need and I'll try to include it.</p>

"Is this safe? (PHP download question)","<p>I have a quick question about how safe this is to do... I have written a php force download script and the part that actually serves the file should look pretty familiar:</p>

header('Content-Length: ' . filesize(""user_files/"".$temp_actual));
header('Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=""'.$filename.""\"""");
readfile(""user_files/"".$temp_actual);

<p>$filename is the filename they see and $temp_actual is the REAL filename on my server. Obviously there is a mountain of code above this to prevent bad things happening but basically, users should be able to download any content they have uploaded. if they upload a .php file, I really dont want it running on the server, i want it delivered to them via force downoad (and they DO need to ba able to upload ANY file type)</p>

<p>it works as intended, with all file extensions being force downloaded, but I just want to make absolutely certain that they cant run any php or html files on my server.</p>

<p>I'm sure this is a trivial question for someone! :)</p>

<p><strong>Additional info</strong></p>

<p>user_files is in the website root however is .htaccess ""deny from all""
every file in the user_files directory is appended .file instead of the original extension the original extension is replaced when the user downloads their file (maybe a bit over the top)</p>

"Is it possible to make this Flex/Flash application safe?","<p>I'm back with another Flex/Flash security question. I've already received <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2299117/post-data-to-a-flex-flash-mxml-application"">some help from the community</a> on this topic, but I'm still not quite sure this is the best way to do.</p>

<p>Here's the thing. A flex web app, a lot of users (1000+), custom configuration of the application depending of the user group. Can I make this thing safe... or safer.</p>

<p>For the moment, when a user comes to the application, there is only one configuration possible, but for the next version we've implented a multi-configuration protocol, this way :<br>
1. The user connect to Default.aspx, server code process the windows credentials (whe are on intranet) and give the correct xml configuration file.<br>
2. The flex app loads with the xml conf file as a flashvar and then the app 'builds' itself with the content of the xml file.</p>

<p>As we know, since this is a flex application the swf is downloaded on the client computer and the xml file too. If more than one user connects to the app, from the same computer, the can possibly see the other xml file in the windows temp folder.</p>

<p>The current directory of the application looks that way :</p>

<pre><code>Web site
    |-&gt; default.aspx
    |-&gt; index.swf 
    |-&gt; configAdmin.xml 
    |-&gt; configUserType1.xml 
    |-&gt; configUserType2.xml 
    |-&gt; com 
         |-&gt; a lot of swf and xml files
</code></pre>

<p>I was first thinking making another directory (without read access for the client) containing all the configurations xml files, picking the right one, copying it to the client and deleting it afterwards. But it seems like I must let know the user know when downloading/deleting content on it's computer...</p>

<p>I'm running out of ideas, so I hope you have some great ones. It's there are some design flaws (in the way the app is build, not in Flash :p) please share. I'm always looking forward to improve.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p><strong>Update :</strong>
In browser Flash/Flex (without AIR that is) doesn't allow deleting file localy silently (on the client computer, where the application is). It's also not yet possible to get session data.</p>

"Interal Server Error 500 - session_start()","<p>Well, I found quite a lot of threads with <strong>ISE 500</strong>, but none of the solutions worked for me.</p>

<p>I developed a facebook app for our client to present some audiotracks and, of course, would like to pass some parameters to the application per app_data param. So I integrated the <strong>facebook sdk 3.1.1.</strong> did everything to connect properly to facebook.</p>

<p>On my local xampp everythings works fine, our companys webserver also runs the application without any problems, so does my private webspace. But when I upload the application to the clients server I get a 500: Internal Server Error. To rule out any weird scripting errors on my side I tried to execute the example.php that comes with the sdk. Same error. Even when I just tried to instantiate the Facebook class like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php

require '../src/facebook.php';

$facebook = new Facebook(array(
  'appId'  =&gt; '???',
  'secret' =&gt; '??????',
));
?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I already looked at the servers error logs. The only thing it mentions is this:</p>

<p><strong>""Premature end of script headers: example.php""</strong></p>

<p>I also used the widely suggested <code>error_reporting(E_ALL);</code> to avoid wrong errorhandling on the serverside. Nothing. The server just wont tell me whats wrong.</p>

<p>I found quite a lot of reasons why other people got this error, the most prominent ones: </p>

<ul>
<li>Missing <code>?&gt;</code> tag in the facebook.php / base_facebook.php</li>
<li>Multiple instances of the <code>Facebook</code>- and <code>FacebookApiException</code></li>
</ul>

<p>...none of the provided solutions worked for me.</p>

<p>So I tried to compare the phpinfos of both, the client and our companys server. Of course there were some differences, but nothing obvious to me. I looked for the basic things people at the forums had already associated with a ISE 500 like the <strong>cURL extension</strong>, <strong>php version (5.3.9)</strong>. I am not a server-admin, I only got a very basic knowledge of server configurations. So to be sure that something is missing i tried to find server requirements for the facebook sdk...</p>

<p>...but the whole web won't tell me server requirements for the facebook sdk. Even the facebook documentation doesn't mention anything. So i hope there might be someone around here who can help me with this.</p>

<p>And yes... i already asked the server-admin for help, he just looked at me with two questionmarks in his eyes... and yes... i have to use the clients server :( <em>sigh</em></p>

<p>Thanking you in anticipation... </p>

<hr>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong><br>
I will list the things i tried in response to your suggestions:</p>

<p>Server:<br>
- cURL extension is installed (7.20.1)<br>
- php version is 5.3.9.<br>
- tried to include other files, works fine. Doesnt seem to be a path-problem<br>
- Server error logs just show ""Premature end of script headers: example.php""<br>
- log_errors is enabled. error_log says 'no value'<br>
- tried <code>ini_set(""display_errors"", true);</code> for bug tracking... no effect<br></p>

<hr>

<p><strong>UPDATE 2</strong></p>

<p>So I was able to identify the problem after checking the facebook files row by row. The Internal Server Error 500 is thrown right at the start after trying to start a session:</p>

<pre><code>if(!session_id())
{
    session_start();
}
</code></pre>

<p>I forwarded this info to the server-admin and the client... i guess its out of my hands now, i will update this post when i get an answer. Thanks for your feedback guys :)</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>SOLUTION</strong></p>

<p>Ok the server-admin now identified the problem. The session.save_handler was set to 'user', He changed it to 'files', now everything works.:</p>

<pre><code>session.save_handler = files

"Can the Selected Excel Custom View be determined","<p>I know I can show a custom view in excel with vba. What I need to do is determine which custom view was selected by a user, to alter a column header based upon that selection. </p>

<p>Is there a way to determine the custom view selected?

"Does my app have some sort of wall I can post to?","<p>I have an app which posts user's activity on my website to Facebook ('Username read an article', etc).  It's also used for login at that site (Connect).  What I'd also like to do is somehow notify each user of the daily updates the site makes in their newsfeed.</p>

<p>I toyed with the idea of posting to each user's stream daily, but that's untenable - that can't scale beyond a couple thousand users with the resources I have.</p>

<p>What I'd like to do is something like a page.  Everyone who is a user of my app gets something in their newsfeed notifying them of an update, much like likers of pages do, however I don't want to have users add the app <em>and</em> like a separate page to get the updates, I just want all users of the app to also get these updates.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>It looks like Apps do have feeds that one can post to.  I used this method, and was given a return value implying success (a post id):</p>

<pre><code>$facebook-&gt;api('/&lt;APP_ID&gt;/feed', 'POST', array( 'link' =&gt; ""http://example.com"", 'message' =&gt; 'Example message'));
</code></pre>

<p>However, I've no idea where this message should show up, and it didn't show up in my personal newsfeed (I've authorized the app in question on my personal account).</p>

"How do I insert variables into Range().Select?","<p>I am developing a spreadsheet to randomly select transactions to be audited.</p>

<p>To do this, I acquire a list of document numbers sorted in ascending order with duplicates removed (this iteration 480+).  As these numbers are not sequential, I create an item column that is sequential. This serves two purposes.  The MAX function allows me to determine the number of documents I need for my sample <code>(MROUND(MAX(R[4]C[-4]:R[485]C[-4])*0.02,1))</code>.  I use 1 and the <code>MAX</code> function in a <code>RANDBETWEEN</code> function to generate random item numbers that I use to pull the corresponding document numbers.</p>

<p>I don't have a problem with doing this, however this will be used by others that are not as capable of dancing with Excel.  As a result, I'm using macros to generate my document lists.</p>

<p>My problem:
I use the <code>RANDBETWEEN</code> function to get one item number.  I then need to copy this <em>variable</em> times to get the rest of the item numbers.  When I recorded a macro, it uses range and identifies a specific range and therefore a hard-coded number of copies.  I need it to make <em>variable</em> copies of itself, with the variable changing for each separate sample and the whole thing changing each month.</p>

<p>Any advice on how to write this into the macro?</p>

<p><strong>Added May 24</strong></p>

<p>Trying to use Offset however it appears I may need to define a variable.  Here's the code:</p>

<pre><code>Range(""W15"").Select
ActiveCell.FormulaR1C1 = ""AuditItem""
With ActiveCell.Characters(Start:=1, Length:=9).Font
    .Name = ""Arial""
    .FontStyle = ""Regular""
    .Size = 8
    .Strikethrough = False
    .Superscript = False
    .Subscript = False
    .OutlineFont = False
    .Shadow = False
    .Underline = xlUnderlineStyleNone
    .ColorIndex = xlAutomatic
    .TintAndShade = 0
    .ThemeFont = xlThemeFontNone
End With
Range(""W16"").Select
ActiveCell.FormulaR1C1 = ""=RANDBETWEEN(1,MAX(RC[-4]:R[481]C[-4]))""
Selection.Copy
Range(""W17"").Offset(Range(""W12"").Select - 1, 0).Select
ActiveSheet.Paste
Application.CutCopyMode = False
</code></pre>

<p>Third line from bottom: Cell W12 is where my number of transactions is stored.  In this case W12=10 so I want 9 copies of Cell W16.  Learning that Offset ignores anything that is not a number, so I get one copy overwriting the ""AuditItem"" heading I created initially.</p>

<p>Suspect I need a variable.  Determined I need to <code>Dim</code> first but keep getting Compile errors.  Syntax I suspect.</p>

<p>Haven't tried <code>Resize</code> yet but thinkI will encounter similar results.</p>

<p>An explanation or links for <code>Offset</code>, <code>Resize</code>, and variable creation in VBA would help.</p>

"jQuery ajax POST causes an immediate GET to the same URL","<p>I'm using jQuery (1.4.2) with a Django backend and doing my development with Firefox (3.5.15) on Debian.  I'm using $.ajax() to post some data to my server, which reflects the data back to the browser.  Firefox is sending the POST, then immediately performing a GET on the same URL.  Where is this GET coming from?  I don't want it to happen.</p>

<p>The code I'm using to POST looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>$.ajax({
    type: 'POST',
    url: '/edit_value/',
    data: JSON.stringify(data_to_post),
    success: function(updated) {
        alert('success');
    },
    error: function(request, description, exception) {
        alert('error');
    },
    async: false,
    dataType: 'json'
});
</code></pre>

<p>I see the success alert message and not the error alert message.  Looking at my server logs, I am echoing back data_to_post correctly.</p>

<p>I've watched tcpdump and see the POST request.  It looks exactly as I would expect:</p>

<pre><code>POST /edit_value/ HTTP/1.1

<p>If async is set to true, sometimes the browser will hang-up the TCP connection early, sometimes the request/response completes.  By setting async to false, the request/response always completes (it was set to false for the above example).  Firefox then immediately sends a GET.</p>

"FB.getLoginStatus triggering browser pop blocker. How can I stop it?","<p>Im calling FB.getLoginStatus, of the Facebook JS SDK, from a button click event. My problem is that if the status parameter is set to true, then the browser pop-up blocker gets triggered, preventing the login dialogue to show. However, when I have the status as false, popup blocker doesn't get triggered. 
I need have the status as true as my site needs to know if the user is logged into Facebook without having to refresh the page.  The False parameter value means that FB just gets the cached login status, which can be wrong if the user logs out of Facebook while still on your site. </p>

<p>How can I get around this?</p>

<p>here is some code that illustrates the problem</p>

<pre><code> $('.my-button').click(function () {

"Scroll Lag with CSS3 box-shadow property?","<p>I added a <code>box-shadow</code> to a section of a page recently to give it the same shadow border effect that is seen on Mac OS X apps. It looked great, but I noticed that scrolling up and down on the page made it lag. I usually only see this on pages that have annoying background images and tons of images and embedded videos plastered all over (<em>cough MySpace cough</em>). I originally decided to use box-shadow since I figured that it would remove the need to use an image, which would remove any possibility of scroll lag.</p>

<p>I know that CSS3 is still new, but is this the reason for the lag? Is the shadow being software rendered or something? When I apply the box shadow to smaller elements, it doesn't lag at all. I'm just wondering if anyone else has experienced this.</p>

<p>I just tried it on the Stack Overflow front page, on the <code>#content</code> div using Firebug with a setting of:</p>

<pre><code>-moz-box-shadow: 1px 1px 10px;
</code></pre>

<p>And I did notice some scroll lag afterwards. I am using Firefox 3.5.</p>

<p>My question is, what are some alternatives to using this attribute if I want to add a Mac OS X style border to a section of my page?</p>

<p>On a side note, does anyone know if it is possible to apply the box shadow only to the top, left, and right sides of the element and not the bottom? I tried <code>1px -1px 10px</code> but it still shows the shadow on the bottom. If I keep decreasing the second offset, it eventually removes the shadow from the bottom but then the top shadow is now way darker and bigger.</p>

<p>And yes, I have seen the articles on box-shadow at:</p>

"How do I copy part of an Excel worksheet to another Excel spreadsheet and retain the formulas rather than just the figures in the cells?","<p>I hope someone can help me as I've wasted so much time searching for an answer to this problem! </p>

<p>I have a large Excel 2007 spreadsheet (macro enabled) that I use as my main spreadsheet for calculating rents to tenants but have run into problems with it suddenly growing in size massively and inexplicably. I think the problem may lie somehow in my use of macros to speed up the production of monthly rent statements, but this is causing the spreadsheet to slow down in use, so before it stops working entirely! </p>

<p>I've started reproducing a copy of it from scratch in a new excel spreadsheet. However, I've already run into the first problem I can't find an answer to inasmuch when I try to copy a portion of my master worksheet containing all my tenant names and the cells containing their monthly, quarterly and yearly rent totals including formulas into the new spreadsheet, all that copies across are the figures and the formatting with the formulas not copied across neither the comments I have inside a number of cells. I understand that if I was copying cells within the same spreadsheet I would select ""Paste Special"" from the Clipboard menu but this option is greyed out when copying a selection of cells into a brand new spreadsheet. </p>

<p>My question therefore is how do I copy everything across from the selected cells in the old spreadsheet to a brand new worksheet inside a new macro-enabled Excel 2007 spreadsheet, to include all comments, formatting, formulas and numbers? Is this possible to avoid the onerous task of manually going through hundreds of cells with figures in, inserting the original formulas into each one? Thanks for any help you can provide. </p>

"In Excel Sheet how to convert the date format of a cell to general format when its value is changed from date to text(or number)?","<p>I find this very strange in excel sheet (or may be its just me), by default all the CELLS in  the excel sheet are in GENERAL format (G) and when I enter date value (1/1/2012) in a cell the format gets changed to date (D4) which is perfect. But when I change back the value to some text value (e.g: train) the format does not change to general format (or text format), it still stays as date format (D4). </p>

"Facebook wordpress plugin breaks my jquery scripts","<p>I've built a jquery photo gallery which loops through all the images and rotates them (webkit transform), but the jQuery script stops silently.</p>

<p>Here's the page with the error: <a href=""http://budnmarys.com/photo_gallery/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://budnmarys.com/photo_gallery/</a>
The script that spreads the album photos is ""spreadPictures()"" and rotate_pictures() doesn't even get to run, both in WP-Polaroid.js</p>

<p>My script IS running on document ready.
I narrowed the error to the facebook plugin for wordpress!</p>

<p>If I remove the facebook scripts added by the FB WP plugin at the bottom of the document, my jquery script automatically works.
The curious part is the facebook album retriever I'm using to get the albums and render the gallery (Facebook photo fetcher) doesn't use facebook scripts in the front end. It just generates the code for the page in the back end, so there's no other facebook script running at the same time when the page lads.</p>

<p>Any idea what could the FB script be doing at the end of the document to completely stop mine no errors?</p>

<p>UPDATE:</p>

<p>The script is supposed to run after all the images are loaded… but they never finish loading when the FB plugin at the bottom of the page runs and breaks the load script (although all the images get loaded fine)</p>

<pre><code>    var $images = $('#fp_thumbContainer div.content img');
    var nmb_images  = $images.length;
    $images.each(function(){
    var $image = $(this);
    $image.load(function(){
        ++loaded; //this never reaches $images.length
        if(loaded == nmb_images){ //this never returns true
            spread_albums();
        }
</code></pre>

<p>I tried setting a timeout for this script to ensure the fb scripts at the bottom of the document runs first, wrapping the FB script in onReady… nothing works.</p>

<p>Locally the page works fine (the images are read fast enough before the fb script breaks it?)</p>

"Bug with Excel form control - scrollbar keeps scrolling","<p>I'm creating a dynamic chart using an Excel form control -- the scrollbar -- and the way this works is exactly as described on <a href=""http://www.excelcharts.com/blog/animation-interaction-and-dynamic-excel-charts/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.excelcharts.com/blog/animation-interaction-and-dynamic-excel-charts/</a> (towards the bottom). I have a chart of data, and a column called ""Chart source"" that just does an index match based on the scrollbar's linked number. When you click through the scrollbar, it updates the chart source column and thus the chart.</p>

<p>The problem I'm having is that when I click the scrollbar, it keeps scrolling all the way, to either the left or the right, instead of moving incrementally one by one. The number counts through 1 by 1, but it goes all the way as if I were continuously clicking the button. This behavior stops in its tracks if I click and then move the mouse out of the arrow area. I've tried messing with the form control's ""incremental change"" and ""page change"" options to no avail. Things that do work: I can click and drag the scrollbar itself to the place I want it. I can type a new number in the cell linked to the scrollbar, and the scrollbar will jump to the right position. </p>

<p>Does anyone have an idea of how to fix this bug?</p>

<p>EDIT: I figured out the problem. This is a bug in Excel. If you are in ""Page Break Preview"" mode instead of ""Normal"" mode, this behavior will happen. Switching back to ""Normal"" mode (the first of the three icons in the bottom right next to the zoom) fixes this behavior.</p>

<p>The main steps to be automated are that:-<br>

Chart lines and names should be similarly blue.<br>
Eg:-<br>
The automation code should search for say products of Wyeth and convert all the Wyeth products name in chart to say red color and line to red color. Similarly the Wyeth products in table should be Bold and Black. The search has to be done over many such sheets.<br>

I would like it to be similar to the way Words with Friends works, where the users' name and profile picture information are used to display the scores.

"Did Lion eat Excel","<p>I'm running on OSX 10.7.3 using Microsoft Office 2008 (with the latest updates). </p>

<p>Recently, Excel started crashing on startup. It happens so fast it is hard for me to detect what's going on but several Excel windows are popping up then the whole thing disappears launching a ""Microsoft Error Reporting"" window.</p>

<p>I uninstalled and reinstalled Office. No improvement.</p>

<p>I called Microsoft and, after waiting several hours (that's right ... hours), a technician helped me walk through some troubleshooting. We set up a test id and Excel worked on that id, so it's something wrong with my id.</p>

<p>The Microsoft technician told me, after we launched FontBook, I had too many fonts in error. Since I've never played with fonts much, I took that as a solution and ended the call. Well, it turns out that the font that my test id has all the same font errors and all the errors are 'duplicates', which were created by Microsoft and the Microsoft ones are inactive.</p>

<p>I've followed other posts and trashed Excel's plists. No improvement. Trying some variations is starting Excel I was able to force it into a 'not responding' state where I could see it was trying to open a file I was using for income tax (which is done and submitted, thankfully). I've renamed that file, moved it around and opened it successfully on my test id. The only thing unusual about this file it was stored in Dropbox ... but I have used Excel on many many Dropbox spreadsheets.</p>

<p>Now I'm thinking this may be related to Lion trying to restart Excel with previously opened files or trying to reinstated Excel to a previous state. I uncheck the Lion preference ""Restore windows when quitting and re-opening apps."" Excel still crashes.</p>

<p>I could use some help with the following:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Is there a way to 'cold start' Excel or any app on Lion?</p></li>
<li><p>Is there some way to tell why Excel is crashing. Microsoft pops up a windows that says ""Microsoft Excel has encountered a problem and needs to close. ..."" There's 'more information' but I don't know what to look for.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I'm not sure if this is an Excel bug, a Lion bug or a combination. Luckily, I have a workaround for now but I'd like to get it fixed.</p>

"Is there a way to have ""default"" or ""placeholder"" values in Excel?","<p>I've got a spreadsheet with cells that I want to be user-editable, but that I also want to have ""default"" or ""placeholder"" values in, whenever there is no user-entered data.  There's a couple good use cases for this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Prevent formula errors, while providing reasonable assumptions when a user has not entered (or has deleted) their own value.
<ul>
<li>I could use conditional formatting to alert the user to default values, so as to prevent their ignorance of them - they can then make an informed choice as to whether that value is still appropriate or not for the intended calculations.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Give a short description of what is intended to be entered in the cell, without having to have a separate ""instructions"" segment or document.  This would also eliminate the need for a nearby ""Label"" cell, in some cases where it's really not appropriate.</li>
</ul>

<p>To accomplish what I want, I need some formula, script, or other advanced spreadsheet option that will do the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Show the default value in the cell before user enters data.</li>
<li>Allow the default value to be found by any formulas referencing the cell, when there is no user-entered data in that cell.</li>
<li>Allow the user to freely (naturally, exactly as they would do with any ""normal"" cell) overwrite the displayed value with their own value or formula, and have the user-entered data found by any formulas referencing the cell.</li>
<li>When cell is blanked by deletion of user input, revert to default value.</li>

"Does a Message authentication code (MAC) ensure authenticity of the key used?","<p>I have to protects confidentiality, integrity and authenticity of a file of records with a password. The number of records can potentially be more then 32^2 and each record can be accessed independently.</p>

<p>One way to implement it is</p>

<ol>
<li>Generate a 256-bit random salt and store it in the file header.</li>
<li>Generate a derived key from the password and the salt using PBKDF2 with HMAC-SHA256 from PKCS #5.</li>
<li>For each record generate a 96-bit random initialization vector.</li>
<li>Encrypt each record's content using AES-256 in GCM mode using the derived key, the initialization vector, and (as additional authenticated data) the position of the record in a file.</li>
<li>As a result, each record will store an initialization vector, an encrypted content, and a MAC.</li>
</ol>

<p>But the <a href=""http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-38D/SP-800-38D.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">NIST Special Publication SP800-38D defining GCM and GMAC</a> requires the number of records to be less than 32^2 for the initialization vectors to be unique.</p>

<p>So I devised another solution: create a key for each record with HMAC-SHA256 using the derived key as a key and the position of the record in a file as a message to be authenticated (salt).</p>

<p>So the question is do I need to provide the position of the record in a file to the authenticated encryption algorithm
as an additional authenticated data since I've already taken care of it when generating the key?</p>

<p>Additionally do I really need to use initialization vectors at all since all the records will be encrypted and
authenticated using supposedly different keys generated by HMAC-SHA256(PBKDF2(HMAC-SHA256, password, salt, iterationCount, 256), blockAddress) ?</p>

<p>I don't know what the size of the file will be, so I presume it can be very large.</p>

"Android permissions: How can I learn which are dangerous vs normal?","<p>Android defines a set of permissions that third-party apps can request.  <a href=""http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/permission-element.html#plevel"" rel=""nofollow"">Permissions are categorized by sensitivity; most permissions are either ""normal"" or ""dangerous""</a>.  Normal permissions are granted automatically, without prompting the user; dangerous permissions are presented to the user when the app is installed and the user is asked to consent to granting them.</p>

<p>Question: For any particular Android permission I have in mind, how can I tell whether it is a normal permission or a dangerous permission?  Is there a list of dangerous permissions and a list of normal permissions?</p>

<p>(I know that third-party apps can declare their own permissions.  I'm only asking about standard permissions.  I know it may not be possible to get a 100%-complete list.  I'm only looking for best-effort; something is better than nothing.)</p>

"Share/Like Video beyond the 20 minute - 100 GB limit","<p>Sorry for the Newby question.</p>

<p>We have created an application for faith-based orgainizations so that they can more easily manage the videos on their own web sites.  We have created a video management platform that gets embedded into the ministrie's existing web site.  Our platform allows even a complete novice to easily add a video to a web page without HTML or programming knowledge.</p>

<p>These videos stream all through a Content Delivery Network [CDN].</p>

<p>Many of our ministry clients want to be able to have their viewers Share that video with their friends on Facebook. </p>

<p>So we worked using the Facebook Open Graph API and added a Share button for each individual video.  </p>

<p>But when we test the Share, while it works fine with a short test video, it does not work with videos over 100 GB or 20 minutes in length.  And there aren't many ministries that can keep a video to under 20 minutes.  And there aren't many ministries that have volunteers with the ability to break the videos into shorter videos.  So we are sort of stuck with 30 to 90 minute videos.</p>

<p>None-the-less, many of the viewers want to Share these videos with their friends via Facebook.</p>

<p>Many of the viewers are older.  So while they can and do Share the videos, trying to have them increase their own individual limits with the mobile verification is a daunting task.</p>

<p>Is there any way for us to get the Share limits increased on any video that is streamed through our site so that each individual viewer that wants to Share does not have to try to increase their individual limits? </p>

"Spreadsheet application that can handle big data OS X","<p>I've been working with Excel for quite a while for some statistical analysis that I do regularly. The size of the data that I'm working with has gotten much larger as of late, however. The layout of the databases in question is quite simple, usually just three rows which includes a UNIX timestamp, and EST value, a proprietary numeric value and finally an average of the rows that have a timestamp +/- 1000 that row's timestamp (little <code>AVERAGEIFS()</code> formula). That formula and the EST conversion are the only formulas in the sheet.</p>

<p>I'm beginning to work with files with 500,000+ rows. Running the average formula down the entire row takes forever. The end result is the production of print-worthy graphs. I'm looking for either a UNIX CL utility or separate spreadsheet/database application that can handle this amount of data without melting my CPU or making me wait an hour. Is there anything out there?</p>

"Firefox crashes rendering large html table (20,000+ rows)","<p>I understand that rendering a table this large is pushing the limits of any browser. However, I was curious as to why a table that is significantly large (20,000+ rows) crashes Firefox, while all other browsers render it relatively quickly.</p>

<p>I am using ASP.NET and writing the table html directly to the buffer with Response.Write. I initially thought that maybe I was generating some malformed html so I decided to recreate the table with a gridview. This proved to slow down Firefox even more, but had only a slightly slower render time in other major browsers.</p>

<p>Firefox creates the first (approximately) 10,000 rows just fine. The problem is after that, it very slowly adds the remaining rows until the application becomes unresponsive, while using an increasing amount of memory (300MB+). Internet Explorer only uses about 30MB.</p>

<p>I am using the most current version of Firefox and all of my add-ons are disabled while testing. Also, I removed all css and javascript from the page.</p>

<p><strong>Is this a known problem with firefox? Has anyone else experienced this? What steps can be done to fix the problem or at least start troubleshooting?</strong></p>

<p>EDIT
I know having this many table rows on a page is a horrible UI design practice. Thanks for everyone who pointed this out, but that wasn't my question. To further clarify I was just curious as to why this works in all browsers except Firefox. </p>

"Propagate server identity through Weblogic EJB calls","<p>Is there a way to assign an identity to a Weblogic server so that calls from one server to another will propagate the calling server identity?</p>

<p>As an example, I have two servers : ServerA and ServerB. I have a test client that looks up an EJB on ServerA and invokes a method on it. The EJB on ServerA then looks up an EJB on ServerB and invokes a method on it.</p>

<p>When using authentication in the first call, the principal is propagated from ServerA to ServerB so that context.getCallerPrincipal() returns the same on both servers.</p>

<p>Now I would like to call the EJB on ServerA without using authentication, and when the EJB is called on ServerB, it should return ServerA's principal when I invoke context.getCallerPrincipal().</p>

<p>The end result is that I want to be able to specify that ServerA can call EJB methods on ServerB, but ServerX for instance shouldn't be allowed to.</p>

"Firefox does not load page from offline cache manifest, but works fine on Chrome (+ cache manifest troubleshooting tips)","<p>This is basically identical to this SO questions which has not been answered: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/q/9467383/1116666"">Offline Web App not caching on Firefox but ok on Chrome</a></p>

<p>I'm experiencing the same problem and I'll provide a bit more information because it might help someone trying to figure out the arcane mysteries and traps of trying to implement cache manifest.</p>

<p>The problem:  hit page reload/refresh and the page should reload from the offline cache, but it doesn't.  </p>

<p>It works fine in Chrome 23:  when I disconnect from the internet and refresh the page, it loads fine and the console shows Application Cache NoUpdate event.</p>

<p>However, Firefox 15.0.1 shows me my 404 page.  </p>

<p>Troubleshooting (Firefox):  Go to Firebug and click on DOM, then applicationCache.  The status shows 0, which means uncached (the page has not been stored offline).  </p>

<p>Troubleshooting (Firefox):  Go to Firefox Options -> Advanced and look at Offline Web Content and User Data.  It shows that my domain is using 1.4MB of data for offline use.  (This is a good place to check for whether your page has been cached).</p>

<p>Troubleshooting (Firefox):  Open a new tab and go to about:cache.  Here you should see a heading for Offline cache device.  Here you can see the Cache Directory, which is where your offline cache files are saved.  If you click on List Cache Entries you'll see the files in your offline cache manifest.  </p>

<p>There are 2 things that I find strange here: 1) is that when I click on any of the files on the list it goes to a blank page that says ""Cache entry information The cache entry you selected is not available.""  However, the files do exist and are not blank in the Cache Directory  2) Although all of the files from the cache manifest are listed, the page that I'm calling is not listed here (in Chrome DevTools it shows up in the manifest as Master:  it is cached automatically even though it's not explicitly listed in the cache manifest file).</p>

<p>Here's what I see when I'm online:  With a cold (empty) cache, when I load the page the console shows the checking, downloading, progress, and cached events, but the cache status is uncached.  Basically, the cache files are downloaded, but they cannot be accessed.   Firebug DOM applicationCache says: 0 items in offline cache (this contradicts what is shown in about:cache and Options -> Advanced).  The status is 1, which means idle.  When I look at the Net tab in Firebug when online, it shows a GET request for the page with a 200 OK response.  The Expires setting shows Wed Dec 31 1969, which I think means that the page will always be fetched.  The other files show a 304 Not Modified response, which means they are being loaded from the browser cache, not the offline cache (the analogous response from Chrome for these files is 200 OK (from cache), which means they are loaded from the offline cache, not the browser cache).</p>

<p>When I'm offline:  With the ""uncached"" cache the GET request fails and it loads the offline fallback 404 page with a 200 OK (BFCache) response.</p>

<p>It seems the offline cache is downloaded because it physically exists on disk and progress events are shown in the console, but Firefox never fires the cached event, so some of the resources have not downloaded successfully.  The files are all png, js, or php format, so no crazy file formats.  Chrome downloads the exact same files into the cache without a problem.  I've also tried mobile Safari and it successfully reloads the page from the offline cache.</p>

<p>Are there any known issues with Firefox not caching certain file types?  I use the .html.php extension on some of my files.  I also generate the manifest dynamically using a php file, so it is only getting files that exist and it hashes them to detect changes and update the manifest.</p>

<p>Next Steps:  I will try a bare-bones manifest to see if I can get it to work, then add files one by one to see which file triggers the error.  Perhaps Firefox doesn't like the fact that I'm dynamically generating the cache manifest instead of manually updating a static file?</p>

<p>I've learned a lot about the arcane intricacies of cache manifest, but I'm more of a hacker than a computer expert.  Has anyone else experienced this quirkiness with Firefox?</p>

<p>The beginning of the page:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; 
&lt;html manifest=""/directory/manifest.php""&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>and then the manifest.php is just</p>

<pre><code>header('Content-Type: text/cache-manifest');
echo ""CACHE MANIFEST\n"";
</code></pre>

<p>etc. etc. It uses RecursiveDirectoryIterator to get all the files in the directory (except the cache itself, which is included by default).  </p>

"Clearing user's Facebook session in Webview","<p>I have a WebView which allows a user to share an image to facebook.  This process involves them logging into FB.  After they're done I destroy the WebView and the app resets and a different user is offered the same functionality.  The intention is for the WebView to not to remain logged in from one session to the next, however, I'm unclear on how to either manually log the user out at the end of their session (calling <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/logout.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.facebook.com/logout.php</a> no longer works, apparently), and grabbing new instances of WebView and WebChromeClient doesn't do it either.</p>

<p>However, I notice that when I reinstall the application (as I modify it) the log in is cleared, so, I'm assuming that *somehow Webkit can tell that this is a different app (as it is uninstalled and re-installed) and I'm hoping I can leverage this (or any other) mechanism to clear whatever it is that holds the user's login info... I'm guessing it's a cookie, but I'm not entirely certain that it is. </p>

For this I have two user-accounts playing the app. So far I am able to GET and POST the score for the logged in user. However I cannot find a way to GET the scores of his friend(s). In the Facebook dev description it states that the (""uid/scores"") request should return both, scores from the user and its friends, but it doesnt. Also trying ""friend-ID/scores"", aswell as ""friend-ID?field=scores"" wont return anything more than:</p>

<pre><code>{
  ""data"": [
  ]
}

<p>I tried nearly all combinations of app-permissions, poking around in the Graph-API-explorer with wild combinations of app_token and access_token requests, user-id and app-id, but nothing comes of it. The data returned is always empty.</p>

<p>What am I doing wrong? What permissions does my APP need so I can GET my friends score for my app(game)? Is it because the game is still in developement/not approved yet? What graph command do I have to send? Has anybody been successfull with getting friends scores?</p>

I would like to use django's flatpages so that the client and his staff can change the content of the app through the django admin of their site.

<p>I already know about the @csrf_exempt decorator, but I am not sure how I would apply it to the flatpage view, as it is within the django.contrib code.

"How do I limit a CouchApp's access to CouchDB's `_user` table?","<p>I'd like to get some advice on how to structure the user data for my CouchDB application.</p>

<p>Here's what we're building: We are creating a suite of applications (mostly leveraging the video api of html5) that train people on different skills. We're going to start with a few simple video lectures coupled with interactive activities. We'd like to save individual user's progress, and in the near future we'd like to create some mini-courses that users take in small and large groups. Multiple users would participate in the same activity either live (like google docs), or over some long duration (like a wiki).</p>

<p>My concern is with private user data. Ultimately it would be the simplest, for us and the user, for them to sign up with their email address and a password. But, in CouchDB's _user database read access to the data is essentially public, and I'd rather not make all my user's email addresses public. How to make those email addresses private is my biggest concern. In addition it would be nice if we could have all user data be private unless the user chooses to make it public.</p>

<p>I have thought of a few options, and read through this article and many others on the wiki: <a href=""http://wiki.apache.org/couchdb/PerDocumentAuthorization"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.apache.org/couchdb/PerDocumentAuthorization</a></p>

"identifying ssh trusts between multiple servers on a network","<p>The problem:</p>

<p>We have many dev/qa/prod RH/Solaris servers with many accounts having ssh trust between them, including between servers in different environments (prod->prod, but also qa->prod). I know this is a bad practice, and the first step I'm trying to take to resolve it is to understand which accounts on which boxes can ssh to which other accounts on which boxes without a password.</p>

<p>My approach was going to be a shell script to log into a specified list of servers, and <code>sudo</code> go through /etc/passwd file to get a list of all accounts and home directories, look at the latter for presence of <code>.ssh</code> and <code>id_rsa.pub</code> and/or <code>id_dsa.pub</code> and <code>authorized_keys</code> and output this information, per account per box, to <code>stdout</code> on the machine running the script.</p>

<p>The fact that users can specify a key for ssh to use that is not the default is an acknowledged limitation. (I'm assuming that is not the case)</p>

<p>Then use the output to create an html page with JavaScript objects {username, machine_name, rsa_key, dsa_key, authorized_keys[]} created from the output above, and use JQuery (or similar) to display the hierarchy (how is tbd).</p>

<p>My question is, does something to address this kind of an issue already exist? And if not, any input on my approach would be welcome.</p>

"Is it possible to make Facebook API requests from my backend while using the iOS SDK for authentication?","<p>I am working on a web service that has a RESTful backend (written using django) and multiple frontends, one of which is iOS.  I would like to have as much as possible done by the backend to minimize the frontend complexity, however, this strategy is failing now that I'm trying to integrate the Facebook open graph.  </p>

<p>What I am currently trying to do is have the user authenticate with facebook using the iOS SDK and then submit the received access token to the backend, with which the backend can, for example, publish an action to the user's timeline.  However, when trying to make requests from the backend, I receive the error message: <code>{""error"": {""message"": ""Error validating access token: Session does not match current stored session. This may be because the user changed the password since the time the session was created or Facebook has changed the session for security reasons."", ""code"": 190, ""type"": ""OAuthException"", ""error_subcode"": 460}}</code></p>

<p>Presumably, this is because Facebook either recognizes that the request is not coming from iOS or that it is coming from a different host.</p>

<p>Is there some way to obtain the code that can be used for <a href=""https://developers.facebook.com/docs/authentication/server-side/"" rel=""nofollow"">server-side authentication</a> from the iOS SDK so that the backend itself can request the access token?</p>

<p>Perhaps I am just looking at this from the completely wrong angle and should implement graph API interactions on each individual front end?</p>

"Keeping track of the Facebook session when navigating pages in iframe-based Facebook applications","<p>I'm working on an iframe-based canvas application and have run into a major roadblock in finding a good way to keep track of the Facebook session when navigating between pages within the iframe. On the first page load, the Facebook page passes all the necessary <code>fb_sig</code> parameters to your callback URL via the query string. On subsequent page loads (after clicking a link in your app, for example), it seems you must do one of the following to retain the Facebook session details:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Use <code>target=""_top""</code> on links and reload the entire Facebook page with each request. That way a fresh set of <code>fb_sig</code> parameters are passed in when the iframe is loaded. But this incurs the cost of loading everything outside the iframe every single time you change pages.</p></li>
<li><p>Manually append all the <code>fb_sig</code> parameters you received from the first page to the URL of all additional pages. This is pretty ugly, and will leave you with outdated information that may no longer be accurate. You continue to use the first values you received from Facebook, but those values may have changed since then (such as the user logging out or the session key expiring) and you'd have no way of knowing.</p></li>
<li><p>Store the information in a cookie and somehow check for new values on each page load, refreshing it if necessary. I've seen this technique mentioned in several places, but after days of looking, I have not found a single example of how to actually do this. Perhaps the PHP client library does it for you automatically, but my application uses Perl and the <a href=""http://search.cpan.org/dist/WWW-Facebook-API/lib/WWW/Facebook/API.pm"" rel=""nofollow""><code>WWW::Facebook::API</code></a> module, and I haven't found anything in it that addresses this. I've also read that this technique runs into issues with certain browsers (Safari in particular) that don't allow you to set cookies within an iframe unless its domain matches the parent frame's domain. All of this seems extraordinarily complicated and poorly documented for what is such an elementary and necessary ability for an application (navigating to another page.)</p></li>

"How to prevent a ""replay"" with Javascript SDK authResponse","<p>I'm using the Javascript SDK to make a web page that is entirely static HTML and Javascript (i.e., it's not dynamically produced web markup via some web app). This web page occasionally uses Javascript to POST data to a server--data which should be tied to a particular Facebook user. I use <code>FB.getLoginStatus</code> to determine who the user is. This gives me <code>authRepsonse</code> JSON data which looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>authResponse:
  accessToken:""AAAC91...""
  expiresIn: 3786
  signedRequest:""Ws93YNGWQeOi...""
  userID: ""670...""
</code></pre>

<p>I can send the <code>signedRequest</code> to the server and decode it and validate it there (using my app's secret key), and then I know that the user is, in this case, ""670..."", so I can presumably safetly perform whatever operation is supposed to happen on the server. Here's the data I extract from the signed request:</p>

<pre><code>{""algorithm""=&gt;""HMAC-SHA256"",
 ""code""=&gt;
  ""2.AQAKT...|5hVFYWcu5a..."",
 ""issued_at""=&gt;1323403518,
 ""user_id""=&gt;""670...""}
</code></pre>

<p>My question is, what prevents an adversary (who somehow got ahold of the encoded authResponse above) from just ""replaying"" the signedRequest data to my server at a much later time?</p>

<p>The ""issued_at"" param at first looked promising, but I don't have anything to compare that issued_at time to to see if I should accept this signedRequest or not. The ""expiresIn"" is another time related parameter, but it's not signed, so I can't trust it. Maybe ""code"" provides me with extra info, but I don't see how to decode that.</p>

<p>I expect I'm just thinking about this wrong, or using the API in a way I'm not supposed to. Any insights? Thanks.</p>

<p>What considerations are there in a situation where you need to authenticate with LDAP (AD) and store user access information in a database (ex. USER table containing username + permissions/roles info)?</p>

<p>Are sessions shared across nodes with no issues? Any differences between Blaze DS and Granite DS?</p>

"Facebook Like Button Content Locker on Wordpress","<p>I've been pulling my hair out trying to figure this out. Hopefully someone can help please.</p>

<p>I'm trying to content lock this site: blog.funnyhunt.com</p>

<p>The idea is that people are supposed to like my facebook page when someone clicks the like button (which works fine) and then the content is revealed... but that last bit does not work.</p>

<p>Now heres the weird part... for some people it works fine, and for others it won't reveal the content it just lets them like the page and the content stays locked.</p>

<p>I've tested this with a range of different like lockers and I keep getting the same experience, some times it works, other times not.</p>

<p>So what is going on?? I've tried testing it with different facebook accounts, proxies, and clearing cookies... but no luck.</p>

<p>Through some reading it seems that SSL will only cover so much and that some sort of a secure connection must be set up between the two. Or does the SSL cover this connection as well? It somewhat seems that it should.</p>

<p>One interesting thing is that the HMAC-SHA1 algorithm is symmetric (one key to encrypt and decrypt) while RSA-SHA1 is asymmetric (requires one key to encrypt and one to decrypt). I think WCF uses the HMAC-SHA1 algorithm because it is symmetric and the SAML token being exchanged is the shared secret (key). It makes sense to use the SAML token as the shared key for a symmetric algorithm but is there an option available to force WCF to use an asymmetric algorithm like RSA-SHA1?</p>

<p>I have been able to get some slight modification of the signature method by changing the binding/security/defaultAlgorithmSuite attribute but the various options do not give me the ability to specify RSA-SHA1 here:</p>

<p>defaultAlgorithm = Default:</p>

<p><code>&lt;SignatureMethod Algorithm=""http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#hmac-sha1""/&gt;</code>

I'm asking this because I'm wondering how a person should get this (unless it has access to my computer when I'm logging in) since the php script is executed before the browser gets it. And if there's a security issue, how can I solve it? Furthermore I've read already about encrypting but I do not see any sense in doing something like this</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
   $Admin=Array
(
    ""Username"" =&gt; ""Admin"",

$AllUsers=Array

</code></pre>

<p>since a person does get the password as well if the person has access to the php script.</p>

<p>My last question is: Is there a way to download source files from a website? (Since that would give the person downloading this the php script and therefore the password)</p>

<p>More context: The webapp uses several third party jQuery plugins but no third party analytics of any kind.  All scripts are hosted on our own server, and an audit of all our code provides no matches for ""cloudfront"".</p>

"Facebook's share dialog apperaring cut with Portuguese label on Android","<p>I'm here again to once more ask about Facebook SDK for Android.
In my application, the user can login and share some content on his account.
Ok until here, now the problem is the share dialog.</p>

<p>After login, this dialog is opened, but how my application is in Portuguese the button Share appears 'Compartilhar' and because of that, this word is bigger, the button is cutted by the dialog, thing that doesn't happen with the english label Share.
Also I realize that the labels of dialogs changing according device's language (reason why I discovered that english label Share appears normally), is there a way for define a default language for that? My application language for default is already Portuguese.</p>

<p>Also, I'd like to know if there's a way to change the label of that button, or something else because I already tried to increase the widht of the dialog and didn't work. I'm using Facebook SDK for Android v3.0</p>

<p>I want to get some other opinions on this...</p>

<p>I like the <em>idea</em> of Code Access Security for desktop applications. But in the lifetime of .NET I have to admit I've never actually had a situation where CAS has actually blocked something to my benefit.</p>

<p>I have, however, had many times where something as simple as sharing a quick .NET application across a mapped drive becomes an enterprise code access nightmare. Having to break out caspol.exe to create trusted path rules and having no clear way of knowing why something failed makes it seem like CAS adds way more frustration to the development and deployment process than it offers in security.</p>

<p>I'd like to hear either some situations where CAS has actually helped more than hurt, or if there are other people out there frustrated with its current implementation and defaults.</p>

"Firefox CSS Cursor on a Button Image","<p>So, I have a DIV full of four HTML buttons that use an image instead of any text. Using CSS, I style it so that the <code>img</code> is the same width as its parent <code>button</code>. On three of the four buttons, they will always carry the <code>cursor: pointer</code> attribute because they will always be clickable. The fourth button, however, will occasionally be in a state in which it is disabled, so I have to toggle the CSS between <code>cursor: pointer</code> and <code>cursor: default</code>.</p>

<p>As my code stands, this works properly in Chrome and IE 7/8/9 (6 is not in my supported audience), however Firefox does not change <code>cursor</code> from default for any of them, regardless of if one of the buttons are disabled. Note that while this does work when I apply the <code>cursor</code> attribute to the parent BUTTON element, I'd prefer to use CSS to have the cursor change rather than use any client-side Javascript. Since this works in two of the three modern browsers I'm testing (including IE7, mind you!), I thought it should be possible in FF too.</p>

<p>Here's the HTML markup that I have:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;button id=""btn1"" class=""my-button""&gt;&lt;img src=""/path/to/my-img1.gif"" alt=""Img1"" /&gt;&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;button id=""btn2"" class=""my-button""&gt;&lt;img src=""/path/to/my-img2.gif"" alt=""Img2"" /&gt;&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;button id=""btn3"" class=""my-button""&gt;&lt;img src=""/path/to/my-img3.gif"" alt=""Img3"" /&gt;&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;button id=""btn4"" class=""my-button""&gt;&lt;img src=""/path/to/my-img4.gif"" alt=""Img4"" /&gt;&lt;/button&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And here are the CSS classes that I have designated for this markup, as well:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;style&gt;
    .my-button {
    display: block;
    float: left;
    margin: 0px;
    padding: 0px;
    vertical-align: top;
    border: none;
    background: none;
    }

    .my-button img {
    cursor: pointer;
    }

    .my-button img .disabled {
    cursor: default;
    }
&lt;/style&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And for anyone with any of that pesky curiosity, all of the click events and action is handled with jQuery depending on whatever business logic I need to go with it and the surrounding page.</p>

<p>If there's more information that I can furnish, please let me know. I feel like I came across a Firefox stumbling block here.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> For reference, I'm using Firefox 4.0 with Firebug installed. Same behavior whether I have a Firebug on for that tab or not.  Chrome is up-to-date, currently at version 10.0.648.204.</p>

<p><strong>Edit 2:</strong> As I've denoted in the comments below, I still have not figured out a solution to this issue, but have settled on using @wdm's answer as a temporary solution - this way Firefox gets <code>cursor: pointer</code> set for all buttons regardless of state, and Chrome and IE will obey the CSS I put forth for the embedded <code>img</code> in each <code>button</code> tag.  If I find out what's going on in my code or if someone else finds a proper solution for Firefox, I'll move the answer there. Thanks again for the suggestions!</p>

"xpcom/jetpack observe all document loads","<p>I write a Mozilla Jetpack based add-on that has to run whenever a document is loaded. For ""toplevel documents"" this mostly works using this code (<code>OserverService = require('observer-service')</code>):</p>

<pre><code>    this.endDocumentLoadCallback = function (subject, data) {
        console.log('loaded: '+subject.location);

    };
    ObserverService.add(""EndDocumentLoad"", this.endDocumentLoadCallback);
</code></pre>

<p>But the callback doesn't get called when the user opens a new tab using middle click or (more importantly!) for frames. And even this topic I only got through reading the source of another extension and not through the documentation.</p>

<p>So how do I register a callback that really gets called every time a document is loaded?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> This seems to do what I want:</p>

<pre><code>function callback (event) {
    // this is the content document of the loaded page.
    var doc = event.originalTarget;

    if (doc instanceof Ci.nsIDOMNSHTMLDocument) {
        // is this an inner frame?
        if (doc.defaultView.frameElement) {
            // Frame within a tab was loaded.
            console.log('!!! loaded frame:',doc.location.href);
        }
        else {
            console.log('!!! loaded top level document:',doc.location.href);
        }
    }
}

var wm = Cc[""@mozilla.org/appshell/window-mediator;1""].getService(Ci.nsIWindowMediator);

"Integrating facebook 'compose new message' popup into my website","<p>I am designing a website that will be heavily integrated with facebook. Members connect to the site via their facebook accounts and facebook authentication/permission is used to access their friends list and other information.</p>

<p>There are instances in which I would like the site to be able to send facebook inbox messages to selected people from the user's friends list (in a user initiated manner).</p>

<p>I have discovered that this is not possible through facebook permissions.</p>

<p>One idea that I have is to have Facebook's ""Compose New Message"" popup to appear overlayed on top of my site (as would appear when clicking the ""Send new message"" button on a user's profile page). The user would then type a message and press send (hopefully circumventing the permissions issue).</p>

<p>I have browsed the facebook developer docs and forums, but my technical knowledge is limited. I just want to know if this is possible or not, and to be pointed in the direction of material on how this could be achieved (so that I can pass this on to hired developers once I reach that stage)</p>

"Vulnerabilities in caching of obfuscated key? Android Licensing","<p>I'm caching a user's authentication to whenever the Android Market Licensing ping server returns a GRANT_ACCESS pong.</p>

<p>Does anyone see any vulnerabilities with this strategy? I believe it is very strong, since I am obfuscating a key, and the only way to unobfuscate is to know the salt. Now, someone could conceivably open the apk and look for the salt, but this is not really the level of cracking I think is too important to worry about. </p>

<p>NEW: As you can see, device specific information is being added to the obfuscation technique. 
<pre><code>
// Try to use more data here. ANDROID_ID is a single point of attack. 
String deviceId = Secure.getString(getContentResolver(), Secure.ANDROID_ID); 
obfuscator = new AESObfuscator(SALT, getPackageName(), deviceId); 
mChecker = new LicenseChecker(this, new ServerManagedPolicy(this, obfuscator), BASE64_PUBLIC_KEY ); 
</pre></code>
 Next the creation of the persisted data:</p>

<pre><code>
 public void allow() {
   SharedPreferences settings = getSharedPreferences(PREFERENCES_EULA, 0);
   SharedPreferences.Editor editor = settings.edit();
   String uid = UUID.randomUUID().toString();
   if(!settings.contains(ACCESS_KEY)) {
     editor.putString(ACCESS_KEY,uid);       
     editor.commit();
   } 
   if(!settings.contains(OBFU_ACCESS_KEY)) {
     String obfu = obfuscator.obfuscate(uid);
     editor.putString(OBFU_ACCESS_KEY,obfu); 
     editor.commit();
   }
</code></pre>

<p>Then, I used another method to check the state of the cached content:
<code><pre>
boolean isCachedLicense() {
  SharedPreferences settings = getSharedPreferences(PREFERENCES_EULA, 0);
  if(settings.contains(ACCESS_KEY) &amp;&amp; settings.contains(OBFU_ACCESS_KEY)) {
    String accessKey = settings.getString(ACCESS_KEY, """");
    String obAccessKey = settings.getString(OBFU_ACCESS_KEY, """");
    try {
      if(accessKey.equals(obfuscator.unobfuscate(obAccessKey))) {
              return true;
      } else {
              return false;
      }
    } catch (ValidationException e) {
       e.printStackTrace();
       return false;
    }
  } else {
       return false;
  }
} 
</pre></code></p>

<p>Finally, 
I check if isCachedLicense in the following locations of the LicenseCheckerCallback:
@Override dontAllow, and @override applicationError. If isCachedLicense is true, then I let the user forward.</p>

<p>The command to be executed is <code>rfrompcb</code> and it takes the path of a file as argument so there is the first level string which wraps the path up as it contains spaces. As this command is to be executed in cmd there is the second level string, which is the argument for cmd command, i.e. <code>cmd /c ""rfrompcb """"file_path""""""</code> (I hope I have got this one right).

"Facebook page likes decreasing","<p>The ‘Like This’ count on my Facebook Band Page has been decreasing since Feb 2, 2012. Looking in the Insights I noticed from 2/2/2012 to the present there have been 200 or so Unlikes.  Likes by some close friends, family including my own Like were no longer listed, I then realized there must be a fault in the Like counter on my page. I tried using the Facebook Debug tool: developers.facebook.com/tools/debug but as I'm not a Facebook developer the utility won't activate.

"Securing PHP's exec and others","<p>I'm currently setting up an hosting service and, for now, i'm very concern about security.
Here is my situation :</p>

<p>I've set up multiple apache's vhost and for obvious securoty reason, i don't want to let a user access other's data by mooving around via php's system's function.</p>

<p>That's why i've set open_basedir in each of my vhost. Nevertheless, I'm still concerned with one major security leak : exec function.</p>

<p>So after some research, i've found that you can use disable_functions in php.ini to , like his name told us, disable some function.
I've foud this list of function to disable who seams pretty complete :</p>

<pre><code>disable_functions = ""apache_child_terminate, apache_setenv, define_syslog_variables, 
escapeshellarg, escapeshellcmd, eval, exec, fp, fput, ftp_connect, ftp_exec, ftp_get, 
ftp_login, ftp_nb_fput, ftp_put, ftp_raw, ftp_rawlist, highlight_file, ini_alter, 
ini_get_all, ini_restore, inject_code, mysql_pconnect, openlog, passthru, php_uname, 
phpAds_remoteInfo, phpAds_XmlRpc, phpAds_xmlrpcDecode, phpAds_xmlrpcEncode, popen, 
posix_getpwuid, posix_kill, posix_mkfifo, posix_setpgid, posix_setsid, posix_setuid, 
posix_setuid, posix_uname, proc_close, proc_get_status, proc_nice, proc_open, 
proc_terminate, shell_exec, syslog, system, xmlrpc_entity_decode""
</code></pre>

<p>But, i don't feel right about <em>limiting</em> php for my users.
So, two questions :</p>

<ul>
<li>Do you think this is a bloquant situation for most of CMS and other web-application ?</li>
<li>If so, is there an other way to isolate each vhost data ?</li>
</ul>

<p>PS : I've looked for suexec and other's but i think they will not fit beacaus i'm expeting 100 to 200 users on my server and i don't want to create and manage a system account for each one.</p>

<p>These products require a ""ProductID"" that ties them to whatever is in the appstore.</p>

<p>I will need to store these IDs somewhere in the application so I know what to send the server when the purchase button is clicked.</p>

<p>I wish to expose these ID's and allow non-programmers to enter any ID they want in both our side and the server side, and not have to call on a programmer to go into the code and change some enum.</p>

<p>I figured a config file would not be very secure, for in the end it's just a text file that a user could potentially view after purchasing the app. May not be a huge problem if a user saw the ID, but I don't like the idea of anybody seeing the innards that go through a payment process</p>

<p>Assuming im making sense here, whats a good way to expose these IDs but still keep them secure so users may not find them?</p>

<p>Also curious, how secure is something like an enum in c++? Can people break the .exe down and see the code and its values?</p>

The image with a big red cross over iPhone is exactly what I have. From xcode project, I click my login button, and I'm directed to this page, and every time I have to click ""Okay"" on this page (let me call it Okay_page) to go back to my app in Simulator, however with login status as FBSessionStateClosedLoginFailed. I checked bundle ID, I have it correct. I don't have a 'YOUR_IPHONE_APP_STORE_ID' yet, which I believe I need pay Apple to get and I will do it later but not while I'm still working on it.</p>

<p>Now get a couple of questions:
1, Do I have to have YOUR_IPHONE_APP_STORE_ID to skip this Okay_page?
2, Does this (not automatically re-directed back to my app from this Okay_page) have anything to do with that I always get a login status of FBSessionStateClosedLoginFailed when I manually click Okay in this Okay_page and return to my app in Simulator?

<p>When ""user"" is logged in surfing with Firefox and from a webpage invokes a search then the process is overtaken by ""www-data"" and in my case the command ends with an opening of a new browser window. This can not be done since ""user"", not ""www-data"", has possession of the display. So my commands ends with ""Error: no display specified"" since ""www-data"" can not access the screen.</p>

<p>Maybe there is a workaround for this problem? Could perhaps the logged in ""user"" be the one running the command process all the way?</p>

<p>Any help appreciated:)</p>

"Insert DataTable into Excel Using Microsoft Access Database Engine via OleDb","<p>I came across instructions today for reading data from a Microsoft Excel file using an <code>OleDbConnection</code> on this website: <a href=""http://www.carlprothman.net/Default.aspx?tabid=87#OLEDBProviderForMicrosoftJetExcel"" rel=""nofollow"">OLE DB Providers</a></p>

<p>This allows me to read in all the data from an Excel file:</p>

<pre><code>private const string EXCEL_CON =
  @""Provider=Microsoft.Jet.OLEDB.4.0;Data Source={0};"" +
  @""Extended Properties='Excel 8.0;HDR=Yes;IMEX=1;'"";

public DataTable ExtractExcel(string tableName) {
  var table = new DataTable();
  string strCon = string.Format(EXCEL_CON, fullFilename);
  using (OleDbConnection xlConn = new OleDbConnection(strCon)) {
    ConnectionState initialState = xlConn.State;
    try {
      if ((initialState &amp; ConnectionState.Open) != ConnectionState.Open) {
        xlConn.Open();
      }
      string sql = string.Format(""SELECT * FROM `{0}`;"", tableName);
      using (OleDbCommand cmd = new OleDbCommand(sql, xlConn)) {
        table.Load(cmd.ExecuteReader());
      }
    } finally { // it seems like Access does not always close the connection
      if ((initialState &amp; ConnectionState.Open) != ConnectionState.Open) {
        cmd.Connection.Close();
      }
    }
  }
  return table;
}
</code></pre>

<p>When I insert data, Step 1 is to blow away the existing table in the Microsoft Access database in case columns have been added, changed or removed:</p>

<pre><code>public void InsertExcel(OleDbConnection dbConn, DataTable table) {
  ConnectionState initState = dbConn.State;
  try {
    if ((initState &amp; ConnectionState.Open) != ConnectionState.Open) {
      dbConn.Open();
    }
    string sql = string.Format(""SELECT * FROM {0};"", table.TableName);
    DataTable original = new DataTable();
    using (OleDbCommand cmd = new OleDbCommand(sql, dbConn)) {
      try {
        original.Load(cmd.ExecuteReader());
      } catch (Exception) { // table does not exist
      }
    }
    if (0 &lt; original.Rows.Count) {
      sql = string.Format(""DROP TABLE {0};"", table.TableName);
      using (OleDbCommand cmd = new OleDbCommand(sql, dbConn)) {
        cmd.ExecuteNonQuery();
      }
    }
    // ****************
    // CODE NEEDED HERE
    // ****************
  } finally {
    if ((initState &amp; ConnectionState.Open) != ConnectionState.Open) {
      dbConn.Close();
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>After the <code>DROP TABLE</code> command is executed (in the <code>CODE NEEDED HERE</code> section), I need to somehow insert the information in the <strong>DataTable</strong>.</p>

<p>How would I insert the table if I don't have any kind of Primary Key, column names, or column data types?</p>

<p>The <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.data.oledb.oledbparameter"" rel=""nofollow"">OleDbParameter</a> has has the <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.data.oledb.oledbparametercollection.addwithvalue.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">AddWithValue</a> method that allows data to be added without having to know the data type. <strong>Is there something similar that I could use to dump in the entire <code>DataTable</code> (or <code>DataSet</code>)?</strong></p>

<p>What I'm currently doing is onload loading the the first set of friends. I then display a button at the bottom of the list that says 'see more friends'. With the click of this button I want to append the next set of friends on to the current list using the data from the paging array in the JSON result.</p>

"Can UAC levels lower than max be turned off programatically?","<p>I was recently told that if your UAC level is anything less than the maximum (always notify) then malicious programs can programatically lower your UAC settings, thereby rendering UAC useless. </p>

<p>Now, I remember this being an issue in the Windows 7 beta, but that is was fixed in the RC:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>With this feedback and a lot more we are going to deliver <strong>two changes to the Release Candidate</strong> that we’ll all see. First, the <strong>UAC control panel will run in a <em>high integrity</em> process</strong>, which requires elevation. That was already in the works before this discussion and doing this prevents all the mechanics around SendKeys and the like from working. Second, <strong>changing the level of the UAC will also prompt for confirmation</strong>. <a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/e7/archive/2009/02/05/uac-feedback-and-follow-up.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">(source)</a></p>

<p>So, which one of us is outdated? Is it me that haven't caught the new rootkits available or is it the other guy that didn't pay attention to things being fixed in the RC?</p>

<p>Is there a working way to lower UAC levels without the UAC prompt?</p>

"ASP GridView Refresh after Excel Export not working","<p>I have a Gridview inside an Ajax UpdatePanel.  Inside each GV row I have a checkbox field.  The idea is that the user checks the lines they want, and click a button to both update a label in that row as ""shipped"" and then also export the checked lines to an xls file (csv really).</p>

<p>When my codebehind fires it loops through the gridview rows, looks for the checks, updates the database to mark each line and then I use .DataBind() to refresh the grid.  This works perfectly and as expected.</p>

<p>Now I want to also export the checked rows to excel.  So I created a method for doing this and popped it in after updating each row for marking the lines and BEFORE the .DataBind() refresh.  Now the .DataBind() never fires to refresh.  I do receive the XLS download and if I manually refresh the screen, the lines are updated as expected.</p>

"Excel General and Custom formating","<p>I want to be able to put the string ""1 - 2"" in an excel cell.  I would be using this string later for other purposes.  As of now if I input ""1 - 2"" (or ""1-2"") it turns into ""2-Jan"" and the cell formatting changes from ""General"" to ""Custom"".  If I input ""=1-2"" I get ""-1"".  I don't want either of these answers.  I want the string to stay as ""1 - 2"" and the formatting of the cell to not change.</p>

<p>Is there a way to do make sure the formatting does not change?  Use of VBA code is fine.</p>

<p>The ranges for some of the series have no data in their cells yet; the user will write/load this data later. The idea is to have the chart ready for when they do. </p>

<p><strong>Problem</strong>: when the loop hits such a yet empty range, I get an error 1004: Unable to set XValues property of the Series class. Why and is there a way around this? </p>

<p>The weird thing is that doing this manually in Chart menu --> |Source Data... works perfectly fine. Actually, if you record a macro while doing this manually, the result is as follows: </p>

<pre><code>ActiveChart.SeriesCollection.NewSeries
ActiveChart.SeriesCollection(4).XValues = ""=Sheet2!R4C31:R32003C31""
ActiveChart.SeriesCollection(4).Values = ""=Sheet2!R4C32:R32003C32""

<p>but then Excel gives an error when re-playing this macro!</p>

<p>Doing this manually is not a pleasant prospect. I guess I could stick sham data in the cells, create the series, and then delete the sham data. Do I really have to pull such a bait and switch on Excel?</p>

"Facebook Feed Dialog through WebView in Unity is Blank","<p>I have been using a WebView dropped into Unity(Found here: <a href=""https://github.com/gree/unity-webview"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/gree/unity-webview</a>) for implementing Facebook connection. The WebView has been working very well for authorization of the user in the OAuth dialog, but when I try to access the feed dialog for posting to a friend, I end up with a blank white screen. The same generated URL when dropped into a browser works just fine.</p>

<p>The feed dialog URL I generate looks like this:
<a href=""http://m.facebook.com/dialog/feed?access_token="" rel=""nofollow"">http://m.facebook.com/dialog/feed?access_token=</a>{Access Token}&amp;app_id={App ID}&amp;from={Authroized User}&amp;to={Selected Friend ID}&amp;link={Post Link}&amp;name={Post Name}&amp;
description={Post Description}&amp;redirect_uri={My Redirect Page.aspx}</p>

<p>Example of the functioning Auth dialog URL I generate looks like this:
<a href=""http://m.facebook.com/dialog/oauth?client_id="" rel=""nofollow"">http://m.facebook.com/dialog/oauth?client_id=</a>{App ID}&amp;redirect_uri={My Auth Redirect.aspx}&amp;scope=publish_stream,publish_actions&amp;response_type=token</p>

<p>Wondering if anyone knows what could be causing this with this particular WebView.  </p>

<p>Thanks in advance for any assistance.</p>

<p>I'm trying to integrate facebook into my app. When I press the login button and filling the email and password, I'm getting an error in the app saying : ""</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>App is misconfigured for Facebook login..</p>
</blockquote>

<p>""
and then I have to press ""Okay"" button and it closes.  </p>

<p>I have already filled the fields in my facebook app, here's a picture: <img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/b3CYb.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Also, in the logcat when I press the ""login"" button (the button the I created that pops the facebook login). I see the following error: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Failed to find provider info for com.facebook.katana.AttributionIdProvider</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why the facebook login isn't working as well?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> After I press the Okay button, the logcat doesn't throw any error.</p>

"is window.open("""", ... impossible with firefox?","<p>In firefox I have opened a locally stored file with the file:// protocol 
(file:///c:/temp/foo.html)</p>

<p>foo.html contains Java Script which (among others) is supposed a new
window <em>without</em> URL:</p>

<pre><code>var new_window = window.open("""","""", ""height=100,left=50,width=200"");
</code></pre>

<p>When this line is reached, Firefox displays this ""Firefox prevented this site from opening a pop-up window"". I don't understand why Firefox gives this warning, obviously, the file (foo.html) <em>is</em> under my control (since it's stored locally and I have opened it with the file:// protocol, and, additionally, the window to be opened doesn't point to any file that could contain any sensitive data, as the url parameter in the open method is set to """".</p>

<p>But besides all this, it seems I <em>can't even</em> force or allow firefox to open the window anyway. There's this ""options"" button on the yellow ""Firefox prev...."" bar which supposedly should allow to create exceptions, yet I can't.</p>

<p>So, the question basically boils down to: how can I allow a local html file to open an empty window with Javascript within Firefox.</p>

"How to create ""upgradable"" encrypting class","<p>The idea is to produce utility class , so that whenever the guys hack the best currently known algorithms and new one comes to the market the only think that the Developer would have to do is to add the NewHighTechEncryptingAlgorithm_Encryptor class and change a global application setting for NewHighTechEncryptingAlgorithm_As_String</p>

<p>My Question is, how to get the size of all loaded bytes for a specific website per Javascript! </p>

"What are the pros (and cons) of using “Sign in with Twitter/Facebook” for a new website?","<p>Myself and a friend are looking to launch a little forum site. I’m considering using the “Sign in with Facebook/Twitter” APIs, possibly exclusively (a la e.g. <a href=""http://lanyrd.com/"">Lanyrd</a>), for user login. I haven’t used either of these before, nor run a site with user logins at all.</p>

<p>What are the pros (and cons) of these APIs? Specifically:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>What benefits do I get as a developer from using them?</strong> What drawbacks are there?</p></li>
<li><p>Do end users actually like/dislike them?</p></li>
<li><p>Have you experienced any technical/logistical issues with these APIs specifically?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Here are the pros and cons I’ve got so far:</p>

<h3>Pros</h3>

<ul>
<li>More convenient for the user (“register” with two clicks, sign in with one)</li>
<li>Possibly no need to maintain our own login system</li>
</ul>

<h3> Cons</h3>

<ul>
<li>No control over our login process</li>
<li>Exclude Facebook/Twitter users who are worried about us having some sort of access to their accounts</li>
<li>Users’ accounts on our site are compromised if their Facebook/Twitter accounts are compromised.</li>
<li>And if we don’t maintain our own alternative login system:
<ul>
<li>Dependency on Facebook/Twitter for our login system</li>
<li>Exclude non-Facebook/non-Twitter users from our site</li>

If I open it and save it with Open Office, without making any changes at all it works. So I'm fairly certain it's related to the quotes.</p>

<p>My question is; how do I read these improperly formatted CSVs?</p>

<p>UPDATE: Cause has been found!</p>

<p>This is specific to the Mac version of Excel. Line breaks are handled differently on Macs for some arbitrary reason, so before using fgetcsv, you should do this;</p>

"Are two database trips reasonable for a login system?","<p>I am designing a login system for a project, and have an issue about it requiring two trips to the database when a user logs in.</p>

<ol>
<li>User types in username and password</li>
<li>Database is polled and password hash is retrieved for comparative purposes (first trip)</li>
<li>Code tests hash against entered password (and salt), and if verified, resets the session ID</li>
<li>New session ID and username are sent back to the database to write a row to the login table, and generate a login ID for that session.</li>

I was thinking of doing this by looping through each employee and using vlookup to verify matches.  I'm concerned doing this many loops will make the macro difficult to use.

I now must update the project to Xcode 4.5 which also requires me to update the Facebook SDK to 3.1.  When I run the project in Xcode 4.5 (without changing anything), it builds and I can connect to Facebook, but of course when I try to run it on my iPhone with OS 6, I get a build failed message. SO, I went through all the tutorials on the FB developer's site, and changed the code that they highlighted, BUT when I put the new code in, I get all kinds of errors. Xcode does not know what I am talking about anymore. For example, I changed the previous general permissions code to the below ""read"" permissions code:</p>

<pre><code>- (BOOL)openSessionWithAllowLoginUI:(BOOL)allowLoginUI {
return [FBSession openActiveSessionWithReadPermissions:nil
        allowLoginUI:allowLoginUI

"Practical non-image based CAPTCHA approaches?","<p>It looks like we'll be adding <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captcha"">CAPTCHA</a> support to Stack Overflow. This is necessary to prevent bots, spammers, and other malicious scripted activity. We only want human beings to post or edit things here!</p>

<p>We'll be using a JavaScript (jQuery) CAPTCHA as a first line of defense:</p>

<p><a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials:Safer_Contact_Forms_Without_CAPTCHAs"">http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials:Safer_Contact_Forms_Without_CAPTCHAs</a></p>

<p>The advantage of this approach is that, <strong>for most people, the CAPTCHA won't ever be visible!</strong></p>

<p>However, for people with JavaScript disabled, we still need a fallback and this is where it gets tricky.</p>

<p>I have written a <a href=""http://www.codeproject.com/KB/custom-controls/CaptchaControl.aspx"">traditional CAPTCHA control for ASP.NET</a> which we can re-use.</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/Puvbf.jpg"" alt=""CaptchaImage""></p>

<p>However, I'd prefer to go with something textual to avoid the overhead of creating all these images on the server with each request.</p>

<p>I've seen things like..</p>

<ul>
<li>ASCII text captcha: <code>\/\/(_)\/\/</code></li>
<li>math puzzles: what is 7 minus 3 times 2?</li>
<li>trivia questions: what tastes better, a toad or a popsicle?</li>
</ul>

<p>Maybe I'm just tilting at windmills here, but I'd like to have a less resource intensive, non-image based <code>&lt;noscript&gt;</code> compatible CAPTCHA if possible.</p>

<p>Ideas?</p>

"What ports are least likely to be probed on the internet?","<p>Suppose you've got a server that runs insecure software and you have to make it publicly accessible, what ports are ""safest"" for providing that service on the internet. By ""safest"" I mean least likely to be port-scanned and probed for vulnerabilities.</p>

<p>My initial thoughts are to use ports that are below 1024 and not used for any known services (e.g. 471/timbuktu) because they will never in regular usage be accessed and probing them reveals potentially malicious intent (as against the interest of the prober).</p>

<p>Note that the internet-side service port will be selected by the firewall - the port of the service on the server will be different (and, notably, the service will not run as root).</p>

<p>Thanks for reading - appreciate your thoughts.</p>

<p>Brian</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Of course this is security through obscurity. That would be why this question has the obscurity tag! <strong><em>;)</em></strong> That it is security through obscurity is not relevant to what I'm looking to find out. While it may be helpful for passers-by who know little about security to have the obvious pointed out, it doesn't answer the question or further the discussion. I expect the emphasis on the concern about security through obscurity is because I've phrased my question poorly.</p></li>
<li><p>None of the answers that have been given really help me. Why would ports above 10000 be preferable? I would expect the opposite. Those are ports that are used by TCP connections going out from consumer machines, therefore the signal to noise ratio of anomalous connections to those ports is much lower on higher ports. Hence, the expectation of assailants to be detected while scanning lower ports is higher and the incentive for assailants to use said high ports or scan them is higher (notwithstanding popular service ports vis-à-vis e.g. <a href=""http://danielmiessler.com/blog/a-summary-of-new-nmap-features-from-blackhatdefcon-2008"" rel=""nofollow"">NMAP's top ports</a>). However, there are many more high ports, so the question is whether the probability of a scan hitting an obscure high port is lower than the probability of hitting a low port for an unused service. This is an emperical data question, I think.</p></li>
<li><p>The internet-side connection port can be below 1024 with NAT. That's the port of relevance. The internal port is irrelevant, hence the application would not run as root (admin privileges, etc.). Even if it did run as root, it could be chroot'd/jailed.</p></li>
<li><p>Port knocking is a great idea. Albeit a creative way to steganographically hide the service (and hence decrease the probability of service discovery), unfortunately it's doesn't answer the question. Thanks for suggesting it though.</p></li>
<li><p>What would really help (and this is the <em>sin qua non</em> of the question) would be some emperical data on what ports are being probed with SYN/connect, and what payloads are being sent to honeypots, etc. That's much broader, but it's really more what would help.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong> 6: It would be valuable to know if those unused ports (i.e. &lt;1024 and not assigned to a service, e.g. ports 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14 ,15, 16, etc) are ever scanned. If you look in your firewall logs, do you see things probing unassigned service ports?</p>

<p>Thanks, again.</p>

        &gt; call back to original function and post to stream
    &gt; if user has already granted permission, then just publish
</code></pre>

<p>That all works lovely.</p>

<p>What I need though, is to catch a case where the user is not logged in to Facebook at all.</p>

<p>This appears to be response code <code>2500</code> where no access token is present</p>

<p>SO I have this code snippe, which catches that case</p>

<pre><code>.....
} else if (((response.error.code) * 1) == 2500) {
    doLogin('publish_stream', postWant, itemId); 
    // post want being the original function and itemId being the item we are ""wanting""
}
</code></pre>

<p>my doLogin function looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>    function doLogin(permRequired, callingFunction, urlAppend) {
        FB.ui({ 
            method: 'oauth', 
            scope: 'email,' + permRequired
        },
        function (response) {
            // DO THINGS NOW WE'RE LOGGED IN
        });
    };
</code></pre>

<p>This is basically exactly the same as my function to get the extended permission, which looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>    function getPermission(permRequired, callingFunction, urlAppend) {
        FB.ui({ method:
            ""permissions.request"",
            ""perms"": 'email,' + permRequired
        },
        function (response) {
            // DO THINGS NOW WE HAVE PERMISSION
        });
    };
</code></pre>

<p>This latter example WORKS, but the Login example just loads a popup saying ""Sorry, something went wrong, please try again later""</p>

<p>Obviously FB.init is already called, the APP is set up correctly, APP_ID declared in FB.init and so on, clearly, as the other stuff works.</p>

<p>FB Login froma  FB Login button works, but I need this to work through this flow in order for the ""frictionless"" behaviour to operate (ie, I can't have another button to click)</p>

"Webpage integration with newest versions of Facebook and Twitter; need to use PHP?","<p>As a test I am trying to create the simplest webpage where I can type a short post and have it simultaneously update my twitter account status and my facebook status.  I also want to be able to read and display past statuses on this page as well.  So basically I am trying to code the simplest example that can push and pull with both twitter and facebook, and eventually not just status updates but all kinds of content from facebook as well.  I've found some tutorials but they seem to be involving earlier iterations of the frameworks, I obviously would like to use the new facebook open graph api and the newer twitter with oAuth.</p>

<p>My background is in Coldfusion, but it seems (especially with facebook open graph) that PHP might be required to set up what I want, is this true?  Also, in order to do this do I have to set up both a facebook application and twitter application, and get the appID's etc?</p>

<p>I've been having a really hard time setting this up and I'm on a bit of a deadline, so if any of you could give me a clear breakdown on what steps I need to go through and sample code to draw off of that would be great. </p>

<p>EDIT::</p>

<p>What I'd really like to do as a test is to make a system that can pull the most recent few posts from all of my social networks. So I would create some kind of base architecture, and then ""hook in"" my social network accounts to be able to push and pull with my system. This sort of thing might require the ubiquity of PHP anyway, so if there is a good sample PHP project that has the basics of this I'd be interested in seeing that as well.</p>

<p>From what I can tell, it looks like the report is telling us that we are not stopping <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_overflow#Security_ramifications"" rel=""nofollow"">integer overflow attacks</a> within querystrings.  While we do use querystrings that eventually resolve to integers, they are first encrypted and then decrypted and converted to int using <code>Convert.ToInt32()</code> before we use them.  I know that we should use <code>TryParse()</code> instead, but even if a hacker were to enter an integer value higher than max, they would fail when trying to decrypt before even trying to convert to integer, which is where the integer overflow would occur in my opinion.  That is unless the error happens when the decryption fails?  </p>

"Stream mp3 with PHP, on Linux+FireFox","<p>I'm trying to stream an mp3 file with PHP and play it on the browser. 
I'm using Ubuntu for both the server ( apache ) and client for testing. My code works on Chrome, but not on FireFox.
When I access the mp3 directly ( so it's served by the web server ) it works on FireFox as well, but comparing the headers that the web server generates with the headers I send in PHP I couldn't find how to fix the problem. ( I'm spying the headers using FireBug )</p>

<p>Here are the webserver generated headers ( That does work ):</p>

<pre><code>Accept-Ranges   bytes
Connection  Keep-Alive
Content-Length  490265
Content-Type    audio/mpeg
Date    Sun, 11 Mar 2012 04:01:45 GMT

</code></pre>

<p>Here are the headers that are sent to the browser from my PHP script:</p>

<pre><code>Accept-Ranges   bytes
Cache-Control   no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, post-check=0, pre-check=0
Connection  Keep-Alive
Content-Length  490265
Content-Type    audio/mpeg

Expires Thu, 19 Nov 1981 08:52:00 GMT

Pragma  no-cache
Server  Apache/2.2.20 (Ubuntu)
X-Powered-By    PHP/5.3.6-13ubuntu3.6
</code></pre>

<p>This is the code I use to stream the mp3:</p>

<pre><code>header('Content-length: ' . filesize($path));
header('Content-Type: audio/mpeg');
header('Accept-Ranges: bytes');

readfile($path);

exit;
</code></pre>

<p>I did also tried other headers which didn't help, such as:</p>

<pre><code>header('Content-Disposition: inline; filename=""name.mp3""');
header('Expires: '.gmdate('D, d M Y H:i:s').' GMT');
header('Pragma: no-cache');
header('Cache-Control: no-cache');
</code></pre>

<p>But like I said, none of these fixed the problem.</p>

<p>Many thanks for any help,</p>

<p>Oded.</p>

EDIT:

<p>OK this appears to be extremely strange. After much debugging, I made sure that the headers and content of the PHP version and the webserver versions are the same, and then I found out what breaks it, but I have no idea why. Here is the scenario that breaks it:</p>

<ul>
<li>1) Store a string of a path in $_SESSION in a previous script. </li>
<li>2) Read this string in the script that streams the mp3. </li>
<li>3) Use this string as the path to load the mp3 file.</li>
</ul>

<p>If I do that, FireFox cannot play the file, when I press on the mp3 player, it prints a ""GstDecodeBin2: This appears to be a text file"" message.
If I hard code the path instead of using the $_SESSION, it works. The crazy thing is that I made absolutely sure that the path in the $_SESSION is correct! Remember that the headers and content of the PHP and webserver versions are identical!</p>

"My OpenGraph action is not showing in the user's feed or activity log","<p>I'm trying to get my head around the Facebook's Opengraph API.</p>

<p>Where I'm up to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Actions and Object Types have been created</li>
<li>The action has been approved</li>
<li>I have publish_actions scope and the action is hooked up to the website (e.g.: <a href=""http://tracker.thankyouwater.org/code/1400"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tracker.thankyouwater.org/code/1400</a>)</li>
<li>I can view the news item representing the action by URL (e.g.: <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/simonrobb/activity/10151135600251211"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.facebook.com/simonrobb/activity/10151135600251211</a>). If I am logged in as another user, I can also view this news item.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, the action doesn't show up on my feed/timeline or my activity log - as far as I can tell, the only way to view this action is by the URL as shown above.</p>

<p>Am I going crazy here? Why isn't the action even showing in my activity log?</p>

"Excel vb project-best practice","<p>I'm not a vb developer neither so familiar with excel. Anyway i have a project to be done using MS Excel (cannot use access). 
System is to provide a ratio analysis(ans some other analysis) of companies where data from an annual report need to entered to the system. Then based on several reports data I can derive graphs and all other information.</p>

<p>My question
Now I can store data in a single sheet like using is as as a database. it'll be like</p>

<pre><code>CompanyName     Year     Data1     Data2    Data3...
</code></pre>

<p>Here the CompanyName can be duplicated as many Years data can be entered. If I use this method Each time I derive company data, I have to search for the relevant rows in the worksheet and keep lots of data in an array as I read through those rows and produce the final result.</p>

<p>Or I can use separate worksheet for each company. Then I only have to search for the relevant sheet name and perform operations in that worksheet it self easily.</p>

<p>So what is the best way to do this?
Thanks</p>

<p>to create an event on a Facebook page. The user who is authenticated is an admin of that page 1234567890 and gave <code>manage_pages</code> and <code>create_event</code> permissions.</p>

<p>However, the event created does not belong to the page, but is instead created as an event of the authenticated user and thus only shows up in his friends’ stream, but not on the page specified.</p>

<p>How can I fix that?</p>

<p>I know that there is the <code>/me/accounts</code> API call that returns access tokens to do API calls on behalf of the user’s pages, but I don’t see where in Facebook’s JavaScript SDK I could actually change the access token.</p>

"VBA: Curiously slow macro for cross-sheet operation (taking 15mins for 7k rows!)","<p>I have an excel file with two sheets, namely; <code>Material Sheet</code> and <code>Resultant Sheet</code>, where the latter is an empty sheet for results. In <code>Material Sheet</code> I have material information along with the movement codes. As for the schema:</p>

<p><code>columnA has MaterialCodes &amp; columnG has MovementCodes</code></p>

<p>Now, for each material there may be multiple rows with differnet movement codes from the movement-codes-set(101,102,201,202,241,242,261,262,561). I need to check the apply the following logic:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>copy all rows of a material from <code>Material Sheet</code> and paste in
  Resultant Sheet`,<br>
  if (count-of-202-for-this-material >= count-of-201-for-this-material) And (count-of-242-for-this-material >= count-of-241-for-this-material) And (count-of-262-for-this-material >= count-of-261-for-this-material)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At the moment, I have the following code (end of post). During the process, it filters the valid material codes and store these codes in Resultant Sheet (not the entire row yet!)</p>

<p>What I want:</p>

<li>The existing code takes too much (like 15 minutes) execution time for ~7000 values. EXTEREMELY SLOW!</li>

<p>FilterWRTMovement is the main driver routine. It calls collectUniqueMaterials function to collect the unique materials from columnA to collectionUniqueMaterials array.

"How to prevent auto-launching of our iOS app from links in FB iOS app?","<p>We have an iOS app that publishes certain activity to Facebook that contains links to pages on our domain. Our intention is for friends to click on those links and view them as webpages.</p>

<p>However, when you click on links in these published stories in the FB iOS app, it's auto launching our app instead of going to an embedded Web View or kicking out to safari.</p>

<p>Note: We still want to have single sign on (SSO), so just want to change the behavior of clicking links in published stories.</p>

<p>To clarify, this is what I'm talking about:</p>

<ol>
<li>My app is able to publishes <a href=""http://foo.com/123"" rel=""nofollow"">http://foo.com/123</a> into the FB newsfeed for a particular user that opts in.</li>
<li>That person's friends see the link, but when they click it, it just goes to <a href=""http://foo.com/123"" rel=""nofollow"">http://foo.com/123</a> in the browser instead of launching my FOO app. This is because my app doesn't yet handle incoming context from FB iOS app.</li>
<li>I still want FB SSO to work from my FOO app. That is, when clicking on FB sign in in my FOO app, it jumps out to the FB iOS app (if installed) and does a single sign on and redirects back to my app.  IOW, I don't want to break this authentication scenario that currently works.</li>
</ol>

<p>What setting in the FB developers App Settings controls this? It's not clear from the documentation.  I see sections for <code>Native iOS app</code> and <code>Website</code> which I currently have set but it's unclear which sub-setting affects the behavior in question. Also, it's not clear even if I was to find the setting, can I affect it without affecting SSO.</p>

"Excel: Search for a project's size based on a specific date","<p>On sheet 1, I have the project's size the start date.  On sheet 2-5, I have the project size start dates for each phase based on the project's size.  </p>

<p>Based on the project's start date, I am trying to search the size table to see if the start date is on or between the specific release date range. </p>

<p>I am trying to combine an if statement to select the size sheet then use something similar to 'vlookup' to through the dates to pull in the Phase.</p>

<p>For the first example on sheet 1, the Start Date is 9/7/2010 and it's Concat is SmallFeb.  I would then look at the Small_Proj sheet under the 'SmallFeb' column and since the Start Date is between Phase 2 (8/31) and Phase 3 (9/28), the result would be Phase2.</p>

"Cisco ASA Config for PCI Compliant Office","<p>We have a small business office, but due to PCI compliance we need to segment this into two internet networks (one 'compliant' and one for any other devices to use).</p>

<p>We currently have a Draytek modem/wan load balancer which also has firewalling but this is very basic and doesn't support seperate security policies on each vlan.</p>

<p>As such, I have just purchased an ASA 5505 and would like some pointers to setting things up:</p>

<p>VLANS: </p>

<ol>
<li>Outside (draytek)  </li>
<li>InsidePci (our secure zone, contains a windows domain controler/dhcp/etc)  </li>
<li>Inside (just a regular network that just has internet access and no connection to vlan </li>
</ol>

<p>My Questions:  </p>

<ol>
<li><p>At the moment everything is on one subnet 192.168.2.x. The draytek has a static IP and everything else is allocated an IP from our Windows DHCP Server. As this windows server will be within the 'insidepci' network I was planning to have this vlan continue to use that, and the regular 'inside' network using DHCP from the ASA. Is that possible?</p></li>
<li><p>Do I need to put the draytek on it's own subnet (so just the draytek is on say 192.168.3.x) as it seems I cant allocate an IP in the same range to two different VLANs.</p></li>
<li><p>From looking at one of the online guides, it seems I would then need an internal router? I wasn't aware of this, I was hoping I could just assign one switch to the 'inside' VLAN and a seperate switch to the 'insidepci' vlan? There isn't a need to communicate between these VLANS but both need to be able to access 'outside' (draytek gateway)</p></li>

I can via this php app add/remove documents (records) from the Solr index.</p>

<p>However, the Solr security is low, and anybody with the right port nr can access Solr and remove documents (records).</p>

<p>I wonder, is it possible to ONLY allow my own php-app to have access to Solr somehow?
Prefferably via Iptables. I am thinking I can only allow my own servers IP to that port, and it would solve my problem, because PHP is a server-side code. But I am not sure.</p>

<p>About the Php-app: <br>
The website is a classifieds website, and when users wants to add or remove classifieds, they do so through a php app, which is this one.
The app has a function which connects to solr and updates the database (index).</p>

"""*Certificate not found* (from client)"" when calling Web Service that requires signing","<p>I have a peculiar problem when calling a web service that expects the message to be signed using WS-Security. If I call using my client application (using Apache CXF) I get a HTTP 500 error message:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>*Certificate not found* (from client)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>while if I call the same service using SoapUI, configured for signing with the same key and key-store, it works as expected.</p>

<p>I noticed that the <code>&lt;KeyInfo&gt;</code> part of the call differs between CXF and SoapUI. With CXF (as below) the KeyInfo is a lot more detailed with <code>&lt;X509Data&gt;</code> sections etc while the SoapUI call contains just a simple <code>&lt;SecurityTokenReference&gt;</code>. I suspect that this difference might be the cause of the server not being able to identify the certificate used for signing.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I'm not in control of the server side thus I cannot do much investigation there. It would be nice to know if this is a known problem and if there are any workarounds?</p>

<p>On the iOS equivalent the response of an apprequest dialog is delivered as a URL which is then parsed and the request IDs are picked from that. I'm looking for the equivalent of that functionality from the Android FB SDK and I've been unable to find it so far either here on stackoverflow or on Google.</p>

<p>The closest I did find was within the hackbook example there is an AppRequestsListener class which contains an onComplete call which takes in a Bundle object.

2. User clicks on Facebook log in button: popup login with Facebook Javascript SDK. If it is a success, pages reload (back to number 1).</p>

"Graph API response with ""Bad request - protocol error"" on earned achievements instead of #3501","<p>I'm using C# with ASP.NET to make a game. I have a method to send post request and it's working fine in all request ( i.e. loging, scores ) exept when I try to give an earned achievement. In this case the server return Bad Request ( status - protocol error ) instead of (#3501) User has already earned ....
 This is a snipped from my method for sending</p>

                request.ServicePoint.Expect100Continue = false;
                byte[] data = encoding.GetBytes(sRequest);

                stream.Write( data, 0, data.Length );
                stream.Close();
                break;
</code></pre>

<p>....</p>

<p>So to give an new achievement I call this method:
SendRequest( achievementURL, achievementParams, <code>POST</code> );
If I make second call Graph API return Bad Request instead of #3501
I can delete earned achievement without error ( SendRequest( achievementURL, achievementParams, <code>DELETE</code> );</p>

<p>I try to use different encodings without any luck. Can it be a bug in Graph API?! ( Graph API Explorer works fine )</p>

<p>As an example: In the following chart I'd like the text marked in yellow also be oriented horizontally:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/nq2Ot.jpg"" alt=""Screenshot""></p>

<p>If I right-click on the chart and select ""Format axis..."" I can choose the orientation, but that only influences the texts ""diff"" and ""imp"", but not the rest.</p>

<p>I've also uploaded the <strong>example file</strong>: <a href=""http://www.file-upload.net/download-6764939/SuperuserExcelPivotAxisLabelExample.xlsx.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.file-upload.net/download-6764939/SuperuserExcelPivotAxisLabelExample.xlsx.html</a></p>

<p>Some interesting facts:</p>

<ul>
<li>If I right-click on the vertical axis, select ""format axis..."" and then change the text orientation from ""horizontal"" to something else, it affects only the values ""A"" and ""B"" on the right, but not the P.. and ""blonde/brown"" (strange!)</li>
<li>I copied the sheet with the example chart to a new workbook and suddenly all the text orientation in the axis was ok (even more strange!!), apparently as it converts the pivot chart into a normal chart without pivot function, so that does not help me either.<br>
So the problem seems to be related to Pivot Charts...</li>

"Terminating a protected antivirus process","<p>I am using the ESet antivirus, and recently its GUI front-end egui.exe hung and was taking 50% CPU (i.e. 100% of one core). Amazingly, I found that I cannot kill it, even with debug privilege enabled. </p>

<p>Now I am curious: how do they implement such defense, and is there a way to kill it short of writing a kernel driver?</p>

<p>The egui.exe process runs under a regular user (non-admin), and I try to kill it in various ways using an administrative account. Here's what I tried. </p>

<ul>
<li>you cannot kill it from task manager</li>
<li>you cannot kill it using pskill</li>
<li>you cannot kill it using process explorer, nor can you attach a debugger to it</li>
</ul>

<p>Then I started some programming and found that:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>under non-privileged user you can open it with PROSESS_TERMINATE access, but actual call to TerminateProcess() fails with error 5.</p></li>
<li><p>under admin account you can open it with any access rights you want (after enabling debug privilege of course), but then calls to TerminateProcess(), GetKernelObjectSecurity(), SetKernelObjectSecurity() all fail with error 5.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This definitely points to some kind of fiddling beyond just setting the process DACL, since if Terminate were not in the DACL, you would not be able to open the process with PROCESS_TERMINATE right in the first place. Are they actually intercepting Win32 API calls? If yes, then how? It's been a while since I did low level system programming, so pardon my ignorance.</p>

<p>I downloaded an ISO for fedora. Went to install it as a VM. It failed 5 times the installer. The warning for the failure was ""possible corrupted install image"".</p>

<p>(I am stubborn and didn't want to download the huge file again) So finally after 5 failures I went to download the ISO again... and I thought... maybe the warning was correct.</p>

<p>So instead of blindly trusting the download I went to verify the ISO using the supplied ""sha256"" checksum. ""!well blow me down Olive Oil!"" Sure enough the first downloaded ISO failed the failed the checksum test!</p>

<p>My question is this... <strong>What is the most likely way (or ways plural) that my ISO got corrupted?</strong></p>

<p>UPDATE:</p>

<ul>
<li>Both downloaded ISO files have the same total number of bytes.</li>
<li>How did I download the ISO file? I downloaded via a link in browser. And then the browser did the download. So http.</li>
<li>How is my computer connected to the internet, physical/wireless? Wireless. Wifi (unsecured... I am aware of the unsecured...).</li>

"Facebook redirect_uri does not recognize user after OAuth","<p>Facebook's OAuth is boggling my mind... again. We have a fairly straight-forward system: </p>

<ol>
<li>User uses OAuth to 'receive' Facebook permissions (basic user info + extended permission: writing on wall)</li>
<li>Via a customized redirect_uri the user is redirected back to our platform where the user information is stored in the database and the user is also flagged 'logged in' using our own login system.</li>
</ol>

<p>However, the problem is that sometimes (I repeat: sometimes...) the user is not recognized through the $user = $facebook->getUser(); request. Only if $user is set, the user is stored in the database as we only know the user is authenticated and are able to use $facebook->api('/me');</p>

<p>The weird thing is that after first trials users are prompted an error, but if they click 'Login with Facebook' again, everything goes well. And again, not all users experience this problem.

"Calling an Excel Add-In method from C# application or vice versa","<p>I have an Excel VBA add-in with a public method in a bas file.  This method currently creates a VB6 COM object, which exists in a running VB6 exe/vbp.  The VB6 app loads in data and then the Excel add-in method can call methods on the VB6 COM object to load the data into an existing Excel xls.  This is all currently working.<br>
We have since converted our VB6 app to C#.<br>
My question is:  What is the best/easiest way to mimic this behavior with the C#/.NET app?
I'm thinking I may not be able to pull the data from the .NET app into Excel from the add-in method since the .Net app needs to be running with data loaded (so no using a stand-alone C# class library).  Maybe we can, instead, push the data from .NET to Excel by accessing the VBA add-in method from the C# code?<br>

File may be created in any public place on server (in public root or in its subdirectories). Bottom of line, I want to write function like this (it must work on both unix and windows servers).</p>

<pre><code>function create_file($path, $filename, $content, $overwrite=false) {
  # body
  ...

  }
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Parameters:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>$path</strong> - file-path (empty or ends with <code>/</code>)</li>
<li><strong>$filename</strong> - any valid file-name (requires dot+extension)</li>
<li><strong>$content</strong> - file-content (anything)</li>
<li><strong>$overwrite</strong> - if set <strong>true</strong>, existing file will be overwritten (default. <strong>false</strong>).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Result:</strong></p>

<p>Function returns <code>TRUE</code> and creates file with content, or <code>FALSE</code> if file-creation was not possible for any reason.</p>

<p><strong>Description of problem:</strong></p>

<p>I expect this function to return <code>true</code> and create file <strong>$filename</strong> on path <strong>$path</strong>, or <code>false</code> if it wasn't possible for any reason. Also if file was successfully opened for writing, need to put <strong>$content</strong> in it.</p>

<p>Argument <strong>$path</strong> is relative path to public directory, and <strong>$filename</strong> is any valid filename. Of course, I want to avoid creating files if path points <strong>outside of public directory</strong>. Function may be called from subdirectory-scripts like this example</p>

create_file('../data/', 'test.info', 'some contents');
# result file: /data/test.info
</code></pre>

<p><strong>What have I tried so far?</strong></p>

I guess there’s problem with writing privileges and <a href=""http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.chmod.php"" rel=""nofollow"">chmod()</a> but to be honest I’m not very familiar with chmod attributes. Also I couldn't check if <strong>$path</strong> points outside of server's public directory.</p>

<p>In short, I want this function to create file and return <code>TRUE</code> if file doesn't exist, or file exists and <code>$owerwrite=true</code>. Otherwise, nothing happens and function returns <code>FALSE</code>.</p>

<p>Additionally, I would like to know reason why file can't be created on some path (just in theory). Incorrect path/filename is only thing I have on my mind and I'm sure there's more about this problem.</p>

"Days in year between certain dates","<p>In OpenOffice (or Excel), I need to calculate the exact number of days that a certain date range falls within a certain year. Eg. the date range 2009/1/1 to 2010/11/01 has 365 days in 2009 and 305 days in 2010.

"understanding where rails authenticity_token is necessary (static page login?)","<p>I have been trying to work out if I can have a login form on my static homepage.  I would like to have some static pages and it would be great to have a login form on them. I spent some time getting more familiar with the authenticity_token that is generated with form_tag and although I realize we want to generally check all requests that aren't GET requests I feel like it might be possible to leave it out for a login because we aren't trusting the user with anything until after they are logged in.  If a malicious site tried to use CSRF at this point it would need to know the login and password at which point the user is compromised anyway.</p>

<p>I definitely don't want to open up any security holes in my application and I appreciate all that rails does to keep this working, but in this situation am I right to think I can just submit a form without the token?</p>

<p>After it crawls the link, look at what link this resolves to. It's not the correct twitter url.  Last night it resolved to [http://twitter.com/#!/d3nidhint] and now it's resolving to [http://twitter.com/#!/_hKnbln] (the former resolves to a twitter page, the latter does not). What gives?</p>

<p>Facebook clearly parses this url and resolves it as something different. If it can do this much, it should resolve the url to the proper twitter page.

"How is bcrypt more future proof than increasing the number of SHA iterations?","<p>I've been researching bcrypt hashing, and of course one of the large benefits of the scheme its ""adaptiveness"". However, how is it anymore adaptive than simply increasing the amount of iterations you make over a SHA-1 hash? Say, instead of SHA-1 hashing a value 1000 times, you increase it to 10,000 iterations. Isn't this achieving the same goal? What makes bcrypt more adaptive?</p>

"Is it possible to extend Facebook tokens with extendAccessTokenIfNeeded in an Android app?","<p>I think this might effect a lot of Facebook/Android developers and yet there does not seem to be that much discussion on the topic...</p>

<p><strong>My question</strong></p>

<p><em><strong>Has anyone successfully refreshed a token using the extendAccessTokenIfNeeded function? If you did have success, what version was the device (or emulator) running?</em></strong>  </p>

<p><strong>Background</strong></p>

<p>I received an email from Facebook saying the offline_access permission will be deprecated from May 1st 2012 and Facebook recommended upgrading to their latest SDK.  Fine.</p>

<p>I upgraded to the latest SDK, the official Facebook app is installed on my device and (eventually!) Single Sign On seems to be working OK.  I am receiving 60 day tokens which again is OK.</p>

<p>Problems started when I tried to use extendAccessTokenIfNeeded(Context context, ServiceListener serviceListener).  I could not get it to refresh my tokens for a longer expiry time.  I waited 24 hours  between attempts but the token would not refresh.  The only way I can get a refreshed token is to log out and login.  This also happened when I used the example project ""Hackbook"".</p>

<p>The most obvious answer is that I am doing something wrong, but, a <a href=""http://developers.facebook.com/bugs/329021273822477/?browse=search_4f72ff9a4923b1722706530"">bug report</a> was submitted to Facebook saying that... ""shouldExtendAccessToken will practically almost always return false.""  This report has been given the priority ""wishlist"".</p>

<p><strong>Alternatives to the extendAccessTokenAsNeeded()</strong></p>

<p>In the <a href=""http://developers.facebook.com/roadmap/offline-access-removal/"">Facebook documentation about offline_access deprecation</a> tokens can be extended using the Graph API.  However this has the <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9549689/protecting-app-secret-for-extendaccesstoken-usage-java-android"">disadvantage of needing the ""App Secret""</a> being included in the URL.  An advantage is that the user would not need to have the official Facebook app installed on their device.</p>

<p><strong>Other ideas and concerns</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>By changing the extendAccessTokenIfNeeded function in Facebook.java to always return true, I think I got it to refresh once.  (The reason I say ""think"" is because it won't repeat the behaviour and I suspect I have to wait another 24 hours before any chance of another success)</p></li>
<li><p>I notice that Hackbook requires <a href=""http://developer.android.com/reference/android/net/http/AndroidHttpClient.html"">AndroidHttpClient</a> to be
imported.  This is only available for API 8 onwards.  Does this mean
that Facebook SSO (in particular token refreshing) is only likely to work  on devices with API 8 and later? </p></li>
<li><p>The <a href=""https://github.com/facebook/facebook-android-sdk/"">Facebook.apk included in the SDK</a> is quite old. Perhaps this is why the tokens don't refresh on emulators running API 8 and later?</p></li>
<li><p>And lastly, all of this only relates to those people that have the
official Facebook app installed! Another method needs to be completed for those people without the official Facebook app (just complaining now!)</p></li>

"Excel: Use a cell value as a parameter for a SQL query","<p>I'm using MS Excel to get data from a MySQL database through ODBC.<br />

"ODBC connection to SQL Server 2008 through VPN failing","<p>I have an Excel add-in that allows users to run queries against a SQL Server database and return the results directly to the spreadsheet. This works fine.</p>

<p>There is now a user in a satellite office who is connecting to our network (shared drive, etc.) through a VPN connection. When he uses the same spreadsheets that work for everyone in the main office, her gets the following error:</p>

<p><em>[DBNETLIB] SQL Server does not exist or access denied</em></p>

<p>What is really strange is that if you run an individual query, it works fine, but it seems like running many queries in succession makes the sheet crap out. It's a little difficult to diagnose as the Excel add-in runs queries internally, possibly many of those. My theory is that when the DB server sees many successive queries come in from an IP that's outside of the network, there's a point at which it refuses to return more data.</p>

<p>Is there any validity to my theory?
Are there configuration changes I can make to the DB that will allow remote ODBC connections to work well?</p>

<p>I have the service setup in IIS with a certificate, so that takes care of the TLS part.  I'm capturing the data using Fiddler.  My client binding follows (for completeness):</p>

<pre><code>&lt;wsHttpBinding&gt;
  &lt;binding name=""WSHttpBinding_IService1"" closeTimeout=""00:01:00""
    openTimeout=""00:01:00"" receiveTimeout=""00:10:00"" sendTimeout=""00:01:00""
    bypassProxyOnLocal=""false"" transactionFlow=""false"" hostNameComparisonMode=""StrongWildcard""
    maxBufferPoolSize=""524288"" maxReceivedMessageSize=""65536"" messageEncoding=""Text""
    textEncoding=""utf-8"" useDefaultWebProxy=""true"" allowCookies=""false""&gt;
    &lt;readerQuotas maxDepth=""32"" maxStringContentLength=""8192"" maxArrayLength=""16384""
      maxBytesPerRead=""4096"" maxNameTableCharCount=""16384"" /&gt;
    &lt;reliableSession ordered=""true"" inactivityTimeout=""00:10:00""
      enabled=""false"" /&gt;
    &lt;security mode=""TransportWithMessageCredential""&gt;
      &lt;transport clientCredentialType=""None"" proxyCredentialType=""None""
        realm="""" /&gt;
      &lt;message clientCredentialType=""Windows"" negotiateServiceCredential=""false"" /&gt;
    &lt;/security&gt;
  &lt;/binding&gt;
&lt;/wsHttpBinding&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>After the three WS-Trust message exchanges, my request finally gets sent, and I get a response.  The problem is that only the Timestamp in the header is signed in the request, and nothing is signed in the response.  This is different than the behavior when just using <code>Message</code> signing with no TLS, since all the expected parts are signed then.</p>

<p>The list of items I expect to be signed follows (straight from the WSDL):</p>

<pre><code>&lt;sp:SignedParts&gt;
  &lt;sp:Body/&gt;
  &lt;sp:Header Namespace=""http://www.w3.org/2005/08/addressing"" Name=""To""/&gt;
  &lt;sp:Header Namespace=""http://www.w3.org/2005/08/addressing"" Name=""From""/&gt;
  &lt;sp:Header Namespace=""http://www.w3.org/2005/08/addressing"" Name=""FaultTo""/&gt;
  &lt;sp:Header Namespace=""http://www.w3.org/2005/08/addressing"" Name=""ReplyTo""/&gt;
  &lt;sp:Header Namespace=""http://www.w3.org/2005/08/addressing"" Name=""MessageID""/&gt;
  &lt;sp:Header Namespace=""http://www.w3.org/2005/08/addressing"" Name=""RelatesTo""/&gt;
  &lt;sp:Header Namespace=""http://www.w3.org/2005/08/addressing"" Name=""Action""/&gt;
&lt;/sp:SignedParts&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This behavior with <code>TransportWithMessageCredential</code> is actually described in a <a href=""http://webservices20.blogspot.com/2009/12/security-gotcha-nonrepudiation.html"" rel=""nofollow"">blog post by Yaron Naveh from Dec 2009</a>; however, I expected that <a href=""http://www.devx.com/codemag/Article/33342/0/page/2"" rel=""nofollow"">explicitly setting the ProtectionLevel would require the signing to take place</a>.  This does not appear to be the case.</p>

<p>Does anyone have a solution to require signing the various parts of the message when using <code>TransportWithMessageCredential</code>?</p>

"How do I securely encrypt information stored on the user's hard drive?","<p>I'm writing a .Net WinForms application and I need to save a password to access a remote service.  I have an XML file that I write all the settings to.  However, I don't want to write the password in plain text into the XML configuration file.  I thought about using <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.security.cryptography.aescryptoserviceprovider.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">AesCryptoServiceProvider</a> to encrypt the information.  This class requires a key to encrypt the data, which I assume I could just leave in the source code of my program.  However, this seems to me to only be marginally better than storing it in plaintext, because the key would always be the same, for all instances of my program.  I could generate a key upon first starting the program, but then, where would be a good place to store that?  One thought that I had is to use a constant key, and a salt that I store along with the password. This would make a unique ""key"" for each persons machine, without having to store the key out in the open.  Is there a standard way of going about storing this type of information on the user's hard drive?  </p>

"Setting a default value for a dynamic cascading validation list in Excel 2010","<p>I have finally figured out how to build a dynamic cascading set of lists in Excel using Data Validation and the INDIRECT function.  However, I'm running into a problem.</p>

<p>I would like to set up my spreadsheet so that whenever a change is made in a data validation list, all subsequent lists are set to a default value.  For example:</p>

<p>Let's say I have List1, List2, List3, and List4.  Each list's values are dependent on the selection made in the list before it.  When I start the spreadsheet, I want all lists to default to ""ALL"".  When the user selects a value in List1, List2 updates with a set of valid choices.  I'd like to default List2 to one of those choices.  However, while I can get List2 to populate with the correct set of selection options, I cannot get my desired default value assigned to it.</p>

<p>Similarly, if the user makes a selection in List1, List2, and List3, then goes back and changes List1, I'd like List2-List4 to default back to ""ALL"".</p>

The problem is that although the websites can't be accessed without inputting the username and password, the files suchs as .jpg can be accessed by directly inputting the full link in the browser.  I want it to be so that the only way the files are accessed through the user webpage.  Also I want each user to be able to access only their own files and not the others.  So here is my code and if there are any additional changes that need to be made to avoid hacking I will greatly appreciate the input.</p>

<pre><code> 1,234,123.00    2,345.00    342.00      12,345.00
</code></pre>

<p>is stored as this:</p>

<pre><code>\"" 1,234,123.00 \"",\"" 2,345.00 \"", 342.00 ,\"" 12,345.00 \""
</code></pre>

<p>when what I really want is this:</p>

<pre><code> 1234123.00, 2345.00, 342.00, 12345.00
</code></pre>

<p>I had been previously using the <code>clipData.Split(new string[] { "","" }, StringSllitOptions.None))</code> function to turn my CSV clipboard data into a series of cells, but this fails when there is escaped formatted text containing commas.</p>

<hr>

<p>I'm asking if anyone can think of a way to split this string into a set of cells, ignoring the commas escaped within the <code>\""</code> bits, since this is how Excel is choosing to escape cells containing commas.</p>

<p>In short, how can I turn a single string containing this:</p>

<pre><code>\"" 1,234,123.00 \"",\"" 2,345.00 \"", 342.00 ,\"" 12,345.00 \""
</code></pre>

<p>into an array of strings containing this:</p>

<pre><code>{ ""1,234,123.00"", ""2,345.00"", ""342.00"", ""12,345.00"" }
</code></pre>

<p>Without ruining my ability to parse a simple comma delimited string.</p>

"Excel: Check value and copy color from a cell","<p>I feel like this question has been asked before, but I am just not really understanding the solutions. I would like to know how to check the values of some cells and copy the colors of those that match to another cell. I have a worksheet that looks like this: </p>

<pre><code>   A        B           C       D               E               F

<p>Some of the values in A, B and C have different colors to mark them as special (background colors, not font colors). I need to take the values from column D, find the match in A and then if/when I find a match, copy the background colors from A, B and C to the background of D, E and F. If I find a D to A match (like row 2, column D to row 4, column A) then the E/F values will also match the B/C values (as shown above), so I don't have to worry about overwriting any values. I am not really fluent in Excel-ese so when I read a solution like this: </p>

<pre><code>Function BGCol(MRow As Integer, MCol As Integer)  As Integer
   BGCol = Cells(MRow, MCol).Interior.ColorIndex

"Safe & Secure Way to Add Domain to Server","<p>I'm trying to find the best way to connect a new domain to the server using PHP. I know it's possible because applications like bitly Pro allow users to connect their domain and bitly begins managing the short domain for them (so they can redirect).</p>

<p>Here is how I imagine it would work, but I want to make sure this is secure, and also want to learn the most secure way to execute this process:</p>

<ol>
<li>User connects domain, domain is validated with regex</li>
<li>User verifies domain is theirs (is this really necessary? they can only edit the domain's DNS if it's their domain)</li>
<li>Server makes API call to DNS manager to add domain (I'm using Linode, so this is an API call, but would this be a master zone, slave zone?)</li>
<li>Application writes new virtual host to httpd.conf</li>
<li>App restarts apache</li>

<p>Is this behavior expected? I understand that there is some ambiguity about requesting to put a scrollbar on top of my own content (e.g. that my horizontal content would go past the vertical scroll bar, so that would have to cover some of the content).</p>

<pre><code>There are many ways to display HTML in a XUL UI:
1) including HTML inline in the XUL document. This should work fine everywhere,
including in panels.
2) include an HTML IFRAME in the XUL document. This currently works fine
everywhere, except that IF the iframe is in a panel, there are some problems
with focus. This bug is about that one issue.
3) instead of a panel, you can create a XUL window using window.open that
contains HTML inline or in an IFRAME, and everything should work.

Having said that, if I open this bug's testcase in a Firefox trunk build, I
*can* tab into the textbox and type into it, so it looks like focus is
basically working now? The problem is that I can't focus the textbox by
clicking on it. In fact, if you click on the arrow to do a search, you navigate
to a new page where there is a textbox that you *can* click to focus.

So I think we have here just some simple bug that's preventing click-to-focus
from working, sometimes. Enn, can you look into that?

<p>How can I get cascading dropdowns/picklists in excel where the users selects, the country, which then narrows down to region and finally product?</p>

<p>So far all I have is a range called 'country' which I can then ""data - validation - source: = country"", but this only gives me the first value, and it doesn't strip duplicates</p>

"facebook graph api get /me/scores does not work for all users","<p>I have the following permissions. 'user_games_activity, user_likes, friends_games_activity, read_friendlists'</p>

<p>I want to access the score of castleville game for all of my friend's who plays it. This is what I am doing right now.</p>

<ol>
<li>getting the friends list. '/user/friends'. </li>
<li>getting user scores of all games for a friend '/friend_id/scores'</li>
<li>checking if castleville game id exists in scores array and extracting the score.</li>
</ol>

<p>Here's the problem in step 2. The '/friend_id/score's does not return data for all users. For some it shows but for most friends the array is blank. It should show all the games or atleast some game the user plays. I tested with one of my friends id who plays dozens of games, on his timeline the scores are shown but no data with '/scores' api query. Its working with another friends id. Checked the privacy settings &amp; app permissions for both users and all was same.</p>

<p>I think I am missing something. Any ideas!</p>

<p>Edit: The problem may be Solved. Changed the category of my app to games and now I can access the scores of all my friends (tested with few and it showed). Although now people would be clicking on Play Game in auth dialog box whereas my app is not a game. </p>

"Passing an array argument from Excel VBA to a WCF service","<p>I'm trying to pass an array as an argument to my WCF service.  To test this using Damian's sample code, I modified GetData it to try to pass an array of ints instead of a single int as an argument:</p>

<pre><code>using System;
using System.ServiceModel;

namespace WcfService1
{
    [ServiceContract]
    public interface IService1
    {
        [OperationContract]
        string GetData(int[] value);
    }
}

using System;
namespace WcfService1
{
    public class Service1 : IService1
    {
        public string GetData(int[] value)
        {
            return string.Format(""You entered: {0}"", value[0]);
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Excel VBA code:</p>

<pre><code>Dim addr As String
addr = ""service:mexAddress=""""net.tcp://localhost:7891/Test/WcfService1/Service1/Mex"""",""
addr = addr + ""address=""""net.tcp://localhost:7891/Test/WcfService1/Service1/"""",""
addr = addr + ""contract=""""IService1"""", contractNamespace=""""http://tempuri.org/"""",""
addr = addr + ""binding=""""NetTcpBinding_IService1"""", bindingNamespace=""""http://tempuri.org/""""""

Dim service1 As Object
Set service1 = GetObject(addr)

Dim Sectors( 0 to 2 ) as Integer
Sectors(0) = 10
Sectors(1) = 20

MsgBox service1.GetData(Sectors)
</code></pre>

<p>This code works fine with the WCF Test Client, but when I try to use it from Excel, I have this problem.  When Excel gets to the service1.GetData call, it reports the following error:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;Run-time error '-2147467261 (80004003)'
&gt;
&gt;Automation error
&gt;Invalid Pointer
</code></pre>

<p>It looks like there is some incompatibility between the interface specification and the VBA call.</p>

<p>Have you ever tried to pass an array from VBA into WCF?  Am I doing something wrong or is this not supported using the Service moniker?</p>

"Determine show/hide status of a given cell in a range","<p>I have a set of values set up as a range, and want to run a given action for each one of them.  This works:</p>

        'Do stuff with listitem

<p>The issue is, I'd like to add a bit of extra functionality; if I hide a given row, I'd like it to pick up on it and not process that row - something along these lines:</p>

<pre><code>Sub demo()
    For Each listitem in Sheets(""Sheet"").Range(""List"").Rows
        If listitem.Visible Then
            'Do stuff with listitem
        End If
    Next listitem
End Sub

<p>Unfortunately, I keep getting <code>Object does not support this property or method</code> when I try that.</p>

<p>Presumably this is possible, so what command do I need to use to get it to work?</p>

<p>I'm using Mustache.js to render a template. Then, I'm using <code>.css</code> to set it to <code>display : block</code> and <code>opacity : 0</code>. Then, I'm setting the <code>.offset</code> and animating to <code>opacity : 1</code>.</p>

<p>All works well in Webkit, but not so much in Firefox. I get the following error:</p>

"overwriting on excel files using java jxl","<p>I made a programme that calculates shortest paths using some data contained in an excel file.</p>

<p>The programme reads all the data in this file to create nodes. if the users input two values, then this programmes searches for the shortest path and returns it. </p>

<p>Now I want the users to be able to add / remove new data to this file. By doing this, they're adding new 'links' or removing existing links.  and the users would be able to see the changes they are making on the shortest path result. </p>

<p>However, I found out that most of the example codes on writing on an excel file is to create a new excel file, and copy whatever was in the original file.</p>

<p>I was wondering if there's any way to modify an existing excel file WITHOUT creating a copy of that file. I actually want the original excel file to change itself. because there are various methods (shortest path method) I've created to work with that exact file.</p>

<p>Any help or example codes would be great. Thanks. </p>

"Firefox Addon Builder - Next Steps","<p>I've enjoyed building a few test Firefox extensions with the Mozilla Addon Builder site and have found the default addon kit modules fine to work with. However, now I want to go beyond the facilities the in-built modules provide and work at a lower level. Is there a way to combine my current code with the more traditional extension API (while remaining in the builder environment) or do I have to download the builder-generated code and edit it manually?</p>

<p>Specifically, I have a working extension which modifies the content of some target pages. I wish to add a feature to also intercept the loading of some external files when they are encountered (linked JavaScript files). I think I can add a listener to the window's DOMFrameContentLoaded event and cancel it if it's the file I want.</p>

<p>If it isn't possible to combine the APIs in this way, could anyone recommend some tutorials or documentation for transitioning from the Addon Builder environment to traditional extension development? The Mozilla tutorials only seem to take you so far.</p>

"Visualization of Excel Worksheet in SharePoint","<p>i have a Problem. I use a excel-sheet where someone enters data. But for example the customer column of one table should have something like a dropdown or combobox, cause otherwise the user has to write the customer in every row. This is not very user-friendly.</p>

<p>I want to show another sheet in the workbook with pivot tables and pivot charts. But if i upload the workbook to sharepoint i cannot open it in the browser because i use ""Data Validation"" for the dropdown menus. </p>

<p>How can i make dropdown for user-friendly input and make it possible to open it in sharepoint. Is it possible?
Or alternatively is it possible to export one Worksheet in excel so that i could upload only the worksheet with the pivot table or pivotchart... </p>

<p>Thanks in advance</p>

<p>EDIT: I've found one workaround. I can create the pivot charts and tables in one file and then simply copy them in a new excel sheet or deleting all other sheets and then uploading it to sharepoint. Then i can view the sheet in the browser and in the excel web access web part. So at least visualization works. But im searching still for a better solution...</p>

"Why does Java tell me my applet contains both signed and unsigned code?","<p>My signed Java applet has been running fine until Java update 19.  Now some but not all of our users on Java Update 19 report a java security message stating that our applet contains both signed and unsigned code.</p>

<p>The process for creating our applet is as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>Clean and Build the applet project in Netbeans IDE.</li>
<li>Open the Applet jar file in WinRAR and add the required mysql JDBC driver .class files to the jar file.</li>
<li>Sign the applet jar file.</li>

<p>Can someone please tell me how to determine what code is signed and what code is not signed in our applet?  Is there a better way to include the mysql JDBC driver jar file in our applet other than copying the jar file contents into our applet jar file?</p>

"Facebook $user locale auth needed?","<p>I don't know why I'm getting this error:
Fatal error: Uncaught OAuthException: An active access token must be used to query information about the current user.</p>

"Facebook Social Comments--limited visibility for any comments not posted to Facebook?","<p>We are considering adding Facebook's ""Social Comment"" boxes to virtually every page of content on our site.</p>

<p>We're willing to allow unmoderated comments via the ""Social Comment"" plugin, but the ""tit-for-tat"" that we would ask of commenters is that they will also post their comment to their wall.</p>

<p>Right now the ""Social Comment"" plugin that Facebook provides allows the user to decide if they will post their comment to their Facebook wall.  If they uncheck the ""Post to Facebook"" box, their comment will appear only on the page they are commenting on, and not on their wall.</p>

<p>We would like any users who choose this option to have their comment set to ""limited visibility.""  Or, better yet, to simply be required to post the comment to their wall in order to post that comment to our site.</p>

<p>Are either of these possible?  I haven't been able to figure out a way to do either.</p>

<p>Another option we've explored (and not had any success with) is making all comments default to ""Limited Visibility.""  Then we would programmatically check for comments that were also posted to a user's wall, and make those comments available.  But so far, I have not been able to programmatically determine if a particular comment was posted to the author's Facebook wall or not.</p>

"Spring MVC + Spring Security + JPA returns Null ModelAndView and won't authenticate","<p>as above I have a webapp in spring MVC in which the following <em>ARE</em> working:</p>

<ul>
<li>a 'toy' version of the authentication in a dummy page with no js/img/css/png assets</li>
<li>URL mapping in the controller. So: <code>http://myhost/myapp/login</code> and <code>http://myhost/myapp/homepage/*</code> all serve up a page</li>
<li>Hibernate/JPA integration</li>
<li>in short, everything EXCEPT that, in the full-fat login page with assets, even when I put in the correct username/pass combination, the authentication is rejected &amp; redirects to the authentication failure URL.</li>
</ul>

<p>(Spring 3.2, Spring Security 3.1.3. I am using XML-based authentication for now - see below - so nothing to do with the Hibernate/JPA piece, I think it's exclusively an issue with how I've set up Spring) </p>

<p>My questions, then are two:</p>

<ul>
<li>is the .png file triggering an authentication call as it's being processed by the servlet? In which case, how do I filter it out? (.jpg .js .css is ignored by default as 'Public Object' and so not security-screened?</li>
<li>Is there something odd with the configuration files (reproduced below) now security has been bolted on?</li>

"Get formula from Excel cell with python xlrd","<p>I have to <strong>port an algorithm from an Excel sheet to python code</strong> but I have to <strong>reverse engineer the algorithm from the Excel file</strong>.</p>

<p>The Excel sheet is quite complicated, it contains many cells in which there are formulas that refer to other cells (that can also contains a formula or a constant).</p>

<p>My idea is to analyze with a python script the sheet building a sort of table of dependencies between cells, that is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A1 depends on B4,C5,E7 formula: ""=sqrt(B4)+C5*E7""<br>
  A2 depends on B5,C6    formula: ""=sin(B5)*C6""<br>
  ...</p>

<p>The <a href=""http://pypi.python.org/pypi/xlrd"">xlrd</a> python module allows to read an XLS workbook but at the moment I can access to the <strong>value</strong> of a cell, not the <strong>formula</strong>.</p>

<p>For example, with the following code I can get simply the value of a cell:</p>

<pre><code>import xlrd

#open the .xls file
xlsname=""test.xls""
book = xlrd.open_workbook(xlsname)

#build a dictionary of the names-&gt;sheets of the book
sd={}
for s in book.sheets():
    sd[s.name]=s

#obtain Sheet ""Foglio 1"" from sheet names dictionary
sheet=sd[""Foglio 1""]

#print value of the cell J141
print sheet.cell(142,9)

<p>Anyway, It seems to have no way to get the formul from the Cell object returned by the <em>.cell(...)</em> method.
In <a href=""https://secure.simplistix.co.uk/svn/xlrd/trunk/xlrd/doc/xlrd.html"">documentation</a> they say that it is possible to get a string version of the formula (in english because there is no information about function name translation stored in the Excel file). They speak about formulas (expressions) in the <em>Name</em> and <em>Operand</em> classes, anyway I cannot understand how to get the instances of these classes by the <em>Cell</em> class instance that must contains them.</p>

"Best practice for app landing page?","<p>I'm using ASP.NET Webforms 4.0, and v5.3.2 of the SDK. Currently my app works fine, but in the new user experience, when they click on the app link, since my app does a Canvas.Authorize, users get immediately prompted to grant permissions. I've seen that for some other apps, when you click the app link, it does not immediately do an auth request. Rather you just see a regular webpage.  Then in that webpage you see a ""proceed"" button. This seems smart. But is there a best practice for this? I assume I can just delay calling the .Authorize() method, but would my regular app users also need to click the ""proceed"" button every time they use the app, despite having already authorized? I was considering using a cookie to decide if this should be bypassed, but that wouldn't work for every computer.</p>

"Windows 2008 R2 NTFS file permissions not working as intended","<p>We just got our first Windows Server 2008 R2 server in. It's going to be a file server. However, I am running into a weird issue with it that seems to be a result of UAC.</p>

<p>When I try to share a folder, I set the everyone group to ""Full Control"" on the share permissions. I then setup the NTFS permissions so they don't inherit from the default security descriptors when you format an NTFS volume and I choose to remove the current descriptors so I can setup my own. I setup so that the local administrators group has full control, the domain\Domain Admins group has full control, and the SYSTEM built in user has full control.</p>

<p>When I do this, I lose permissions to the folder as a domain administrator. What is causing this to happen? The machine has been joined to the domain and the Domain Admins group is part of the local administrators group (not that that should matter anyway since I specifically have the domain admins in the NTFS permissions).</p>

<p>This is what the default NTFS security descriptors look like:</p>

<p>This is what the modified security looks like:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.imgur.com/h4msL.png""></p>

<p>Why would this cause the logged on domain administrator and any other domain admin to lose access? This behaviour is not seen on a Windows Server 2003 machine.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: I've done some more testing and it appears only the logged on user of that machine is denied access, even though the user logged on is a member of the Domain Admins group. A Domain Admin has no problem accessing the share through the network.</p>

<p><strong>Edit 2</strong>: Alright, so thank you to Zoredache below, I was able to get on the right track and figure out what was going on. It was indeed UAC but not the default UAC settings that comes on Windows Server 2008 R2. We actually have a domain wide UAC group policy object that was changing the default settings on the server.</p>

<p>This is the default settings:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.imgur.com/RvOJU.png""></p>

<p>And this is what the settings on the GPO were:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.imgur.com/DdW7V.png""></p>

<p>Since GPO takes precedence to local security, this is what was stopping me from seeing the NTFS permissions or gaining access to the folder.</p>

<p>I've fixed this behaviour by simply making a new UAC GPO and WMI filtering it to servers only.</p>

"Save an embedded Word document in an Excel spreadsheet to disk using VBA","<p>We have a Excel spreadsheet that currently generates a report using a Word template stored on the company LAN. This works fine for internal users but not for anyone not connected to the LAN e.g. laptop users.</p>

<p>Management does not want to distribute the template as a seperate file to external users but would prefer to embed this into the spreadsheet on a hidden worksheet. It is then proposed that when generating a report that the embedded template would then be saved to the users temp path and the report generated from there.</p>

"is it possible to have self defined source data to create pivot table?","<p>I was wondering if anyone could help me with this. I have to create a pivot table from a worksheet named as ""raw"". Unfortunately, sometimes the name of the worksheet can be some other names such as test or even experiment.</p>

<p>My code is as follow to use a macro to create a pivot table.</p>

<pre><code>Range(""A1:Z1048576"").Select

Sheets.Add

ActiveWorkbook.PivotCaches.Create(SourceType:=xlDatabase, SourceData:= _
""raw!R1C1:R1048576C12"", Version:=xlPivotTableVersion12 _
).CreatePivotTable TableDestination:=""Sheet1!R3C1"", TableName:= _
""PivotTable1"", DefaultVersion:=xlPivotTableVersion12
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, my 'SourceData:= raw' which is the name of the worksheet. As I have explained earlier that this raw can be any name by the user it self, so i was wondering if it is possible to create a pivot table from a worksheet that has names that user that uses the macro, self defined its name.</p>

<p>I have also tried using rename coding, but i have to know the worksheet name before i can do anything else..</p>

<p>Follow up:</p>

<p>My GUI has an open and start button to start the whole thing.</p>

<pre><code>Private Sub testFinder_Click()
    'Open button
    Dim fileToOpen

    fileToOpen = Application _
    .GetOpenFilename(""Text Files (*.txt), *.txt"")

    If fileToOpen = False Then Exit Sub

    TextBox1.Value = fileToOpen
End Sub

Private Sub CommandButton2_Click()
    'start button

    Application.ScreenUpdating = False

    Workbooks.OpenText Filename:=TextBox1.Value, Origin:=437, _
    StartRow:=1, DataType:=xlDelimited, TextQualifier:=xlDoubleQuote, _
    ConsecutiveDelimiter:=False, Tab:=True, Semicolon:=False, Comma:=False _
    , Space:=False, Other:=False, FieldInfo:=Array(1, 1), TrailingMinusNumbers:=True

Note: man in the middle should be no better than man pretending to be.</p>

<p>As far as I see it, if the data is changed the attacker cannot recompute the correct hash of the new text.

<p>It's strange because, The same url &amp; login  works fine on a earlier firefox version 3.6 or so on a Windows-Vista. </p>

<p>1) Isn't there any setting like 'compatibility mode' in Firefox which would allow sites using some older technology or whatever causes the mismatch to work correctly?</p>

"Excel file with PivotTables - reduce size","<p>I have an Excel file with several tabs, one of which has two PivotTables. The data source for the first table is a specific range of rows (not an entire column) and the second table is based on the first. The size of the file is ~12 MB. If I remove this tab with the PivotTables the size goes down to ~1 MB.</p>

<p>I have two related questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>How can I select specific columns for the PivotTable in the data source? When I tried to do this in the Wizard I got a ""Reference is not valid"" error.</li>
<li>Are there any other methods to reduce the size of the file? It seems ridiculous that a file would increase 12-fold in size because of this tab.</li>
</ol>

"Which Editor/IDE is used at Facebook","<p>I'm just wondering which Editor/IDE is used at Facebook, because of those reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>When i'm looking at the videos on the facebook site, I see the most developers using a macbook for there work</li>
<li>Facebook has a really big code base (I guess :) )</li>
</ul>

<p>I mean, at my two screen workspace I'm using Eclipse for PHP/JS/etc. stuff. But on my 13"" MacBook Pro, Eclipse simply needs too much space. I'm also rolling some ""big"" projects and in my opinion VIM has not anoth features (like intelligent code assist) for those.</p>

<p>I guess the developers at facebook use different IDEs and Editors, but I would really like to know which ones are used the most.</p>

"How to force Chrome/Firefox/Opera to do crossdomain requests from localhost?","<p>Hy,</p>

<p>So I've got this problem: I'm trying to develop an HTML file on my localhost, and all the browsers I have installed are preventing me to send cross-domain requests.</p>

<p>What I'm trying to do is to convert a script I wrote in Python (with Mechanize, pyquery and lxml) to Javascript, the reasons don't really matter (I thought in Javascript it would be easier to simulate something).</p>

<p>Cross-domain requests from local files used to work, and are still working on the latest Safari (stable), but I can't install Safari on this machine (it's a Linux box).</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>I discovered the escalated privileges of Firefox, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>netscape.security.PrivilegeManager.enablePrivilege(""UniversalBrowserRead"");
// among others
</code></pre>

<p>Problem is, I'm also trying to access the content loaded in an iFrame ... as I said, I'm trying to simulate a browser session, like I would with a library like Mechanize, but from Javascript. My script still works in Safari.</p>

<p><strong>So how to force Chrome / Firefox / Opera to bypass all security restrictions from locally stored files?</strong></p>

<p>I'm interested in a browser command-line option, I would even consider a patch to the browser (I'm the user, not trying to distribute this to anyone else).</p>

"Memory leaks with jQuery in IE 7/8/9 and FF 4","<p>I have been struggling with some memory leaks using jQuery in all major browsers, and am looking for some help.  I've read many articles on memory leaks, references, circular references, closures, etc.  I think I'm doing everything right.  But am still seeing memory increases in IE9 and FF4 and orphans in sIEve that just don't make sense to me.</p>

<p>I've created a test case to showcase the issue.  The test case basically has a large table of 500 rows, and users can click on each row to enter an inline edit mode where  elements are appended using jQuery.  When users exit inline edit mode, the  elements are removed.</p>

<p>The test case has a button to emulate 100 clicks for 100 rows to quickly magnify the issue.</p>

<p>When I run it in sIEve, memory increases 1600KB, in use goes up by 506, and there are 99 orphans.  Interestingly, if I comment out the .remove() on line 123, memory increase 1030KB, in use goes up by 11, and there are 0 orphans.</p>

<p>When I run it in IE9, memory increase 5900KB.  A refresh increases another 1500KB and another run increases anotherr 1K.  Continuing this pattern continues the memory use increase</p>

<p>When I run it in FF4, I get very different behavior if I use ""100 clicks slow"" and ""100 clicks fast"".  Emulating slow clicks has a peak increase of 8300KB and it takes a minute for it to settle down to 3300KB.  Emulating fast clicks has a peak increase of 27,700KB, then it takes a minute to settle down to 4700KB. Note this is the exact same code that is executed, just with less delays between executing.  A refresh and another run continues to increase memory at a similar rate.</p>

"implement ""select all"" check box in Rails","<p>I'd like to implement a ""select all"" checkbox for a table of records (analogous to how it's done in webmail). My plan is as follows: for each row/record the checkbox should carry the id in its <code>value</code> attribute. Then in my Rails controller I would validate that the logged in user has access to these records by retrieving records and comparing ids (unless there's a better way for doing authorization). Finally, do something with records (delete, move etc.)
Do you think it would take a lot more development effort to create a map with masked ids and use that in checkboxes or is the current approach fine? Any libraries (client or server-side) that might come in handy?</p>

"How to control access to third party HTML pages","<p>We have a Learning Management System (LMS) that runs on its own server (IIS/Server 2003).  Students must login with Forms authentication to gain access to the content.  We want to offer access to third party flash and audio that is embedded in HTML pages hosted on the third party server (IIS/Server 2003).  Currently we use a frame in a pop-up window that is populated via a simple URL to the third party HTML pages.</p>

<p>How can the third party control access to their content, so that only students who launch the pop-up windows from our site can access their content?  Since the content is mostly video and flash, we would prefer not to stream all of their content through our server to the Student.</p>

<p>We have a programming staff, so we could maybe...<br>
- either post or get for our HTTP request to the third party server<br>
- we could use SSL<br>
- we could programmatically assign a global NT user account to all of our users and then do some kind of Active Directory login from the LMS server to the third party server<br>
- could the third party content be hosted at Amazon S3?  Would this allow for secure access/download?</p>

"Set ArrayFormula to many Excel cells using VBA","<p>I have an array formula that outputs a single value, and I want to give a whole bunch of cells this same array formula. The problem is when I assign the array formula to the range, it interprets the formula in such a way as them all sharing the output of a single call to the array formula, rather than each of them outputting a separate value.</p>

<p>To show you what I mean, I'm using the following code:</p>

<pre><code>With MarginalData
    .Range(.Cells(2, 1), .Cells(13, .UsedRange.Columns.Count)).FormulaArray = pullFormula
End With
</code></pre>

<p><strong>What I want</strong>, is a result that looks like this:
<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/Rs3rq.png"" alt=""desired result""></p>

<p>That is what it looks like when I enter the array formula separately in every cell in the range.</p>

<p>But <strong>what I get</strong> is this:
<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/Auiru.png"" alt=""given result""></p>

<p>The output of the array formula in the first cell is repeated in all the columns - they all share the same output.</p>

<p>How can I programatically assign the array formula as though each cell had it assigned separately?</p>

<hr>

<p>The formula is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>{=INDEX(BatchResults,MATCH(TTID&amp;CHAR(1)&amp;ROW()-1,BatchResultsTTIDS&amp;CHAR(1)&amp;BatchResultsLayers,0),MATCH(A$1,BatchTTIDData!$1:$1,0))}</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It must be put in as an array formula because it performs a match not on a single column, but on two concatenated columns. The concatenation of the columns must be returned as an array, hence the formula must be entered as an array formula.</p>

<hr>

<p>The simplest solution so far, a variant of the accepted answer below, is the following:</p>

<pre><code>Const pullFormula = ""=INDEX(BatchResults,MATCH(TTID&amp;CHAR(1)&amp;ROW()-1,BatchResultsTTIDS&amp;CHAR(1)&amp;BatchResultsLayers,0),MATCH(A$1,BatchTTIDData!$1:$1,0))""
With wrksht

<p>My thread gets terminated performing <strong>startActivity(intent)</strong>, which I suppose handles the control to package Installer and invokes the installation process. When I checked the logcat log file to see what made the thread terminate, I found the message that I posted above about the <strong>protectionLevel</strong>. I hope I am clear now.

"Good Firewalling practice for internet facing servers?","<p>Does it make sense to firewall an internet facing server, say a webserver? Assuming I did not want to restrict anyone from accessing the webserver in its capacity to serve web pages, I would be blocking other servcices on the machine.</p>

<p>If the machine is locked down adequately, would this be necessary?</p>

<p>One risk I could think of is if a vulnerability was exploited on the webserver and the attacker tried to open a reverse command shell....using the firewall to block outgoining connections initiated by the webserver would stop that.</p>

<p>However, is the overhead of a firewall worth protecting for that scenario? Are there other attack scenarios I may be missing?</p>

<p>Does having a firewall in front of an internet facing server not also increase the chances of the server being inaccessable due to a DoS attack (easier to do on a firewall from what I understand).</p>

We also have a firewall so that users on the net can browse the internet (proxy). The firewall is an UTM appliance and also has a DMZ port.
Now I thought we could also put a webserver (or similar) on one VM and make it accessible on the internet. This virtual server would get one dedicated NIC on the ESXi which is connected to the DMZ port of the firewall. Would this be a good idea or are there any (security related) considerations against this scenario? Since its a seperate NIC it would get its own vSwitch on the vCenter and would have no physical connection to the internal net. But the vCenter manages the whole host and has access to all NICs etc. so I'm not sure if this is the best solution.</p>

<p>Is there a better way of doing this.  I have read via a Google search about using a table approach with an array to achieve the same effect.  However, in my case the status of a player determines the score of a player and this complicates things for me.  Here are the 10 possible statuses (if statements) broken down as follows with how scored are calculated:</p>

<pre><code>TransferStatuses    Cols
Playing             8+9+10+11
TW1-IN              9+10
TW1-OUT             8
TW2-IN              10+11
TW2-OUT             8+9
TW3-IN              11
TW3-OUT             8+9+10
IN1OUT2             9
IN1OUT3             9+10
IN2OUT3             10



8 = ColK (Transfer Window 0)
9 = ColL(Transfer Window 1)
10 = ColM (Transfer Window 2)
11 = ColN(Transfer Window 3)
</code></pre>

<p>The 'score' array will be along the lines as follows:</p>

<pre><code>=VLOOKUP(C2,$S$2:$T$11,2,FALSE)
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is that I don't know how to put it all together to make it work, i.e. I have to extend my formula to 300 cells but I don't know how to implement it so that the array calculates the scores correctly for each player?</p>

"Is /dev/random data a psuedo-random AES cypher, and where does the entropy come from?","<p>My current understanding of an entropy pool is that it gathers truly random <em>bits</em> of data at a slow rate.  I'd like to know how Unix &amp; Linux collect entropy, and how that entropy is used by /dev/random.    </p>

<p>I've heard (generically) of entropy collection methods such as the video card cpu's status when a ""randomly"" selected network packet arrives, matched against the hiss factor in the digital-analog converter, and other even more obtuse methods.   </p>

<p>I believe that the entropy ""pool"" is tapped as need be, and is used to seed a psuedo random generator.... </p>

<p>I'm not after an in-depth answer, but I am interested to know if this is the general approach used by Unix/Linux ?.. and perhaps some hints about  what is actually going on at the entropy-collection coal-face... and then, <em>what</em> is the entropy fed into..

"How to change the title bar text of a Userform in VBA?","<p>I'm maintaining an old-ish application written in VBA for Excel 2002 (XP)/2003, and am trying to internationalise it.</p>

<p>To do this, I read in the translated strings dynamically and update the various controls on my userform by updating their .Caption property.</p>

<p>This works as expected for all controls but not for the form itself -- when I change the form's .Caption property, then the title bar keeps displaying the ""hard-coded"" value, and the new value is instead displayed just below it, at the top of the ""canvas"" of the form itself.</p>

<p>Is it possible to change the title bar text of a UserForm after it has been shown, or do I have to change the .Caption property of the form before it is shown in order for it to be reflected in the title bar rather than in the canvas/client area?</p>

<p>My code looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>' in frmFoo
Private Sub UserForm_Activate()
    ' ...
    TranslateDialog Me, ""frmFoo""
    ' ...
End Sub

' in a VBA module
Sub TranslateDialog(pForm As UserForm, pFormName As String)
    Dim new Caption As String
    Const notFound As String = ""###!!@@NOTFOUND@@!!###""
    ' ...
    ' GetMessage() returns the translated message for a given key, or the
    ' default value (second parameter) if no translation is available.
    ' The translation key for the form caption is the form name itself.
    newCaption = GetMessage(pFormName, notFound)
    If newCaption &lt;&gt; notFound Then pForm.Caption = newCaption
    ' ...
End Sub
</code></pre>

<p>As I said, the assignment to <code>pForm.Caption</code> does have an effect - but it doesn't write to the title bar of the window, but rather directly beneath it. I'm running Excel 2003 on Windows XP SP 3.</p>

"How to prevent cross-domain ajax requests?","<p>How can I detect if my php script is being called from another domain and the other domain is making illegal use of my script? Is there a way to prevent this too? </p>

"Spring MVC: Using @Autowire is getting references to different spring bean instances","<p>I have a UserCredetnialsDatSourceAdapter defined in my Spring app context file. I also have a custom filter added to the Spring via the DelegatingFilterProxy. </p>

<p>This filter is using the @Autowire to get a reference to the DataSource Bean.  I also @Autowire the DataSource in my DAO. When I debug I see different instance id's to the datasource in the Filter and DAO instances.  Why are there 2 instances whenthese are singletons by default? </p>

<p>I also fired up jvisualvm and I looked at the heap and all my beans in my app context have 2 instances? Thanks for any insight maybe the bean pre/post processing has something do with it or maybe I should not be using @Autowire in a Filter. Any help is apprciated. Thanks!</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;context-param&gt;
&lt;param-name&gt;contextConfigLocation&lt;/param-name&gt;
&lt;param-value&gt;/WEB-INF/config-context.xml&lt;/param-value&gt;
 &lt;/context-param&gt;

 &lt;servlet&gt;
    &lt;servlet-name&gt;springmvc&lt;/servlet-name&gt;
    &lt;servlet-class&gt;org.springframework.web.servlet.DispatcherServlet&lt;/servlet-class&gt;
    &lt;load-on-startup&gt;1&lt;/load-on-startup&gt;
 &lt;/servlet&gt;

&lt;servlet-mapping&gt;
    &lt;servlet-name&gt;springmvc&lt;/servlet-name&gt;
    &lt;url-pattern&gt;*.html&lt;/url-pattern&gt;
 &lt;/servlet-mapping&gt;

 &lt;init-param&gt;
&lt;param-name&gt;contextConfigLocation&lt;/param-name&gt;
  &lt;param-value&gt;/WEB-INF/web-context.xml,/WEB-INF/config-context.xml&lt;/param-value&gt;
 &lt;/init-param&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Interesting I think I see what it going on. There are 2 instances because there are 2 contexts. One for the app and 1 for each request (Thread) I assume?  Is there a way to specfiy which context to use?  Maybe filter is not the answer and I will need to use AOP. Need to research how to inject a bean in @Aspect, if that is even possible. </p>

<p>Thanks!!</p>

"formatting labels for a horizontal line on an excel chart","<p>When I create a horizontal line (Level 1, Level 2 below) in excel and add labels, it adds the label name both to the left and right of line. How do I change this to only show the label on the right of the line and remove the left ones?</p>

"How to turn of the inner border for Facebook 'Like Button' in IE7/IE8?","<p>I have seen that even on big sites like CNN, etc. have it. I tried targeting the  element which showed up those edges in IE developer toolbar but it didn't work. 
Check out the link and hover over the 'like' button...it shows some kind of inner black border in all four corners.</p>

"Automatically log facebook user into my site","<p>I've set up a facebook login for my site, using the faceboko php-sdk example.php method. It's working fine, but I want a user who has already allowed my site once to be automatically logged into my site, if they're logged in facebook. </p>

<p>Currently, if a user who has previously 'allowed' my application visits my site while logged in with facebook, they need to click <code>login with facebook</code>, then they are redirected and logged-in. Even though after that click, they don't need to provide any credentials or anything. Thus I would just like this step to be removed and for a user to be automatically logged in.</p>

<p>I hope that makes sense. Thanks</p>

"Security updates to 3.3.2","<p>I know all security updates are important but given that how important on a scale from 1 to 10 is it to upgrade from 3.1.3 to 3.3.2.</p>

<p>I have some sites that need to be upgraded but the host has me locked down in an older version of php that limits me to 3.1.3.</p>

"posting photo to facebook raises exception","<p>i wrote a function to post a photo to a users wall and it raises the following exception</p>

<pre><code>Fatal error: Uncaught OAuthException: A user access token is required to request this resource. thrown in C:\xampp\htdocs\upd8r\application\helpers\base_facebook.php on line 1039

<p>this is my code- what am i missing?</p>

<pre><code>function facebook_img_post($fb_id,$data){

        //new fb post

    }

<p><strong>update</strong></p>

<p>this is the link the user registered with showing all the permissions requested</p>

<pre><code>$data['loginUrl']   =   $this-&gt;facebook-&gt;getLoginUrl(array('scope' =&gt; 'read_stream,publish_stream,status_update,offline_access'))
</code></pre>

<p><strong>update 2</strong></p>

<p>I swapped the api out and tried it with curl to have more control and apparently i need a user access token- even though i was retrieving and using an application access token- apparently there are two different ones.</p>
