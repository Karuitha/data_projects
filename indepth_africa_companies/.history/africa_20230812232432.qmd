# **Background**

Recently. I published a data analysis project titled [] in my Rpubs site. The analysis provoked quite a bit of interest that it motivated me to go a little deeper into analyzing the corporate landscape in Africa. In this mopre comprehensive analysis project, I use data from the [Africa Business](https://african.business/2023/05/long-reads/africas-top-250-companies-in-2023-doing-business-in-tough-times) to explore the 250 largest formal corporations in the continent ^[The data is available on this link <https://african.business/2023/05/long-reads/africas-top-250-companies-in-2023-doing-business-in-tough-times>]. 

# **Objectives**

The primary objectives of the analysis is to explore trends in the corporate environment in Africa. 

Specifically, we examine the following matters. 

1. Which companies have the best financial performance in 2022 and 2023?
2. Which countries have the highest concentration of companies in the top 250 largest corporations in Africa?
3. Which industries have the highest concentration of companies in the top 250 largest corporations in Africa?

# Data
I scrape the data using Libreoffice calc. [Libreoffice calc](https://www.libreoffice.org/discover/calc/) is the equivalent of Ms Excel except that it is free to use. Next, I load the required python packages and read in the data. 

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
```

```{python}
africa = pd.read_excel("africa250.xlsx")

africa.head(10)
```

# **Data Exploration**

## **Variables, Observations, and Data Types**

Lets us check the variables and observations present in the data. There are 250 observations of 9 variables. 

```{python}
africa.info()
```

The variables in the data are the following. 

```{python}
africa.columns
```
