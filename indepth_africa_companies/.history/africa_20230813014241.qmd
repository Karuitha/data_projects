# **Background**

Recently. I published a data analysis project titled [] in my Rpubs site. The analysis provoked quite a bit of interest that motivated me to go a little deeper into analyzing the corporate landscape in Africa. In this mopre comprehensive analysis project, I use data from the [Africa Business](https://african.business/2023/05/long-reads/africas-top-250-companies-in-2023-doing-business-in-tough-times) to explore the 250 largest formal corporations in the continent ^[The data is available on this link <https://african.business/2023/05/long-reads/africas-top-250-companies-in-2023-doing-business-in-tough-times>]. The data consists of 250 largest companies in Africa together with revenue, net income, and market valuation for the years 2022 and 2023.

# **Objectives**

The primary objective of the analysis is to explore trends in the corporate environment in Africa. 

Specifically, we examine the following matters. 

1. Which are the top ranking companies in Africa in 2022 and 2023?
2. Which companies have the best financial performance in 2022 and 2023?
3. Which countries have the highest concentration of companies in the top 250 largest corporations in Africa?
4. Which industries have the highest concentration of companies in the top 250 largest corporations in Africa?
5. What is the correlation between market value of a company on the one hand and revenues and profits on the other?

# **Key Findings**

# **Data**

I scrape the data using Libreoffice calc. [Libreoffice calc](https://www.libreoffice.org/discover/calc/) is the equivalent of Ms Excel except that it is free to use. Next, I load the required python packages and read in the data. 

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
```

```{python}
africa = pd.read_excel("africa250.xlsx")

africa.sort_values(by = "ranking2023", inplace = True)

africa["stock_exchange"].replace(["BOTSWANA"], ["Botswana"], inplace = True)

africa.head(10)
```

# **Data Exploration**

## **Variables, Observations, and Data Types**

Lets us check the variables and observations present in the data. There are 250 observations of 9 variables. 

```{python}
africa.info()
```

The variables in the data are the following. 

```{python}
africa.columns.values
```

- Ranking2023: The company ranking by market value in 2023.
- Ranking2022: The company ranking by market value in 2022.
- Name: The company name.
- Sector: The company sector of business operations.
- Stock exchange: The stock exchange where company stocks are listed.
- Market_value_22: The company market value in 2022.
- Market_value_23: The company market value in 2023.
- Revenue_latest: Latest reported company annual revenues.
- Net_income_latest: Latest reported company net income. 

We find that has captured the variables ranking2022 and market_value_2022 as text rather than numeric values. To correct this anomaly, we convert these variables to the appropriate data format. 

```{python}
africa["ranking2022"] = pd.to_numeric(africa["ranking2022"], errors = "coerce")
africa["market_value_22"] = pd.to_numeric(africa["market_value_22"], errors = "coerce")

africa.info()
```


## **Missing Values**

We examine the missing values in the variables. For the rankings, all the missing values relate to new entrants in the data. For instance, a company may have entered the list of 250 companies in 2023. Hence, ranking for 2022 is a missing value. Likewise, a company may hae been ranked in 2022 but dropped out of the ranking of 250 companies in 2023.

```{python}
[col for col in africa.columns if africa[col].isnull().any()]
```

We see the columns that have missing values. Our interest is in revenues and net income. 

```{python}
africa.isna().sum()
```

```{python}
plt.style.use("fivethirtyeight")
africa.isna().sum().sort_values(ascending=False).plot(kind = "barh",
title = "Missing values", color = "blue")
plt.ylabel("Variable")
plt.show()
```

# **Answering Pertinent Questions**

## Which are the top ranking companies in Africa?

In this section, I concentrate on the top 20 companies in Africa. The top company for 2 years running is `Naspers` of South Africa, a company dealing in consumer non-cyclicals. First Rand Bank and Standard Bank Group from South Africa come a distant second. 

```{python}
africa[["name","sector","stock_exchange",
"market_value_22","market_value23",
"revenue_latest", "net_income_latest"]].head(20)
```

Notable is that 15 of the companies in the top 20 are from South Africa. That is a ratio of 75%. 

```{python}
africa[["name","sector","stock_exchange",
"market_value_22","market_value23",
"revenue_latest", "net_income_latest"]].head(20)["stock_exchange"].value_counts().plot(kind = "pie", title = "Domicile of Top 20 Companies in Africa", autopct = "%1.0f%%")
```


Which industriee have the most companies in the top 20? The chart below shows shows that companies in the non-energy materials and finance dominate the top 20 with 40% and 25% shares, respectively.

```{python}
africa[["name","sector","stock_exchange",
"market_value_22","market_value23",
"revenue_latest", "net_income_latest"]].head(20)["sector"].value_counts().plot(kind = "pie", title = "Top 20 Companies in Africa by Sector", autopct = "%1.0f%%")
```


## Which are the top ranking companies in Africa (Outside South Africa)?

Given the dominance of South Africa in the sample, I create a subset of data that excludes companies from South Africa  and rerun the analysis.The aim is to list the top 20 companies in Africa not domiciled in South Africa. We see that Morocco, Nigeria, and Egypt top the list. 

```{python}
africa[africa["stock_exchange"] != "South Africa"][["name", "stock_exchange"]].head(20)["stock_exchange"].value_counts().plot(kind = "pie", title = "Domicile of Top 20 Companies in Africa (Outside South Africa)", autopct = "%1.0f%%")
```

Outside South Africa, telecommunications, non-energy materials, and finance are the dominant sectors for the top 20 companies. 

```{python}
africa[africa["stock_exchange"] != "South Africa"][["name", "sector"]].head(20)["sector"].value_counts().plot(kind = "pie", title = "Domicile of Top 20 Companies in Africa (Outside South Africa)", autopct = "%1.0f%%")
```

Let us see the countries and industries with the highest representation in this sample. 

```{python}
africa[africa["stock_exchange"] != "South Africa"][["name", "stock_exchange"]].head(20)["stock_exchange"]
```

## Which countries have the highest concentration of companies in the top 250 largest corporations in Africa?

In the previous section, we concentrated on the top 20 largest companies. Here, we examine the entire sample data. Which country has the largest number of companies in the top 250?

We see that South Africa still leads with 38%, followed by Egypt(13%), Morocco (12%), Nigeria and kenya (9% and 4% respectively).

```{python}
africa["stock_exchange"].value_counts().plot(kind = "pie", title = "Domicile of Top 20 Companies in Africa (Outside South Africa)", autopct = "%1.0f%%")
```



## Which industries have the highest concentration of companies in the top 250 largest corporations in Africa?

## What is the correlation between market value of a company on the one hand and revenues and profits on the other?
