# Predicting patients falls using data from China
This was my final project for the Data Science Professional Certificate by Harvard University on EdX. I used data from patients in China to predict the likelihood of a patient falling. The techniques used include multinomial logistic regression, decison tree model, random forest model, and XGBoost.
