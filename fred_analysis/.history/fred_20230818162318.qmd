# **Background**

In this analysis, I use data from the Federal Reserve bank of St Loius Database (FRED) to illustrate data analysis using Python and Pandas. As a starting point, I load the required packages- Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly. The package `fredapi` does not come into Python by default. I hence install it and then load it.

# **Objectives**


# **Summary of Results**


The broad objective of the analysis is to showcase working with data from the FRED api in python.

The secondary objective of the analysis are as follows:




# **Data**
I start by installing the packages fredapi and plotly.

```{python}
# !pip install fredapi
# !pip install plotly
```

Next, I load the required modules: matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, pandas, plotly, and fredapi.


```{python}
## Import the required modules
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import plotly.express as px
from fredapi import Fred

## Set options
plt.style.use("fivethirtyeight")
pd.set_option("max_columns", 500)
```

Next, we shift oir attention to our data source: FRED. FRED database is owned and maintained by the federal reserve bank of St. Louis in the United States. The database contains a vast array of economic variables from countries across the globe. The [link](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/) to the database is <https://fred.stlouisfed.org/>. The database consists of `822,000` variables from `114` sources across the globe.

I load the data from the FRED api. To start downloading data, you have to request for an `api` key from FRED by creating an account. From your account, you can then get an api key. You will then create write code as follows:

```
fred_api = "your_fred_api_key_here"
```

I have hidden my API key for obvious reasons. Please generate your own api key from FRED. 

```{python}
#| echo: false
fred_api = "cf28c84ab7cd78f96a0c20fde86206a0"
```

Next, we create a Fred object to allow us to access the data.

```{python}
fred = Fred(api_key=fred_api)
```

From here, we can search or pull data from FRED. 

```{python}
fred.search("Kenya")
```

We see that we have 365 variables (the rows in the search term) available for Kenya. It is now up to us to choose what we desire to analyse.
