# **Background**

In this analysis, I use data from the Federal Reserve bank of St Loius Database (FRED) to illustrate data analysis using Python and Pandas. As a starting point, I load the required packages- Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly. The package `fredapi` does not come into Python by default. I hence install it and then load it.


# **Data**
I start by installing the packages fredapi and plotly.
```{python}
!pip install fredapi
!pip install plotly
```

Next, I load the required modules: matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, pandas, plotly, and fredapi.


```{python}
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import plotly.express as px
from fredapi import Fred
```

Next, we shift oir attention to our data source: FRED. FRED database is owned and maintained by the federal reserve bank of St. Louis. I load the data from the FRED api.
