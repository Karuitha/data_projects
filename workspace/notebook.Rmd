# Loan Data

Ready to put your coding skills to the test? Join us for our Workspace Competition!  
For more information, visit [datacamp.com/workspacecompetition](https://datacamp.com/workspacecompetition)

### Context
This dataset ([source](https://www.kaggle.com/itssuru/loan-data)) consists of data from almost 10,000 borrowers that took loans - with some paid back and others still in progress. It was extracted from lendingclub.com which is an organization that connects borrowers with investors. We've included a few suggested questions at the end of this template to help you get started.

### Load packages

```{r setup, message=FALSE}
library(skimr)
library(tidyverse)
```

### Load your Data

```{r, message=FALSE}
loans <- readr::read_csv('data/loans.csv.gz')
skim(loans) %>% 
  select(-(numeric.p0:numeric.p100)) %>%
  select(-(complete_rate))
```
