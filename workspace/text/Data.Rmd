# **The Data**

This dataset ([source](https://www.kaggle.com/itssuru/loan-data)) consists of data from almost 10,000 borrowers that took loans - with some paid back and others still in progress. It was extracted from lendingclub.com which is an organization that connects borrowers with investors. We've included a few suggested questions at the end of this template to help you get started.

## ***Understanding the Data***
The dataset has `r nrow(loans)` rows and `r ncol(loans)` variables. Table () below describes the variables.
